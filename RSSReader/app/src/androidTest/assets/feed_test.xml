				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Market Digest – Week Ending 4/28/2017</em></p>
<p>U.S. stocks closed down Friday, but up 1% for April despite weak GDP data.  Large tech institutions reported earnings, with Amazon and Alphabet having large gains this week after their quarterly results beat estimates. Overall Profits of S&#038;P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 12.4% in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters. </p>
<p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
S&#038;P 500: 2,384.20 (+0.46%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US: (+1.73%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.28% (+0.04%)<br />
Gold: $1,268 (-0.1%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.089 (+1.49%)</p>
<p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monday – GM loses legal bid to limit fallout from ignition switch cases</li>
<li>Tuesday – Case Shiller’s monthly home reports came out – for the fourth consecutive month, property values nationwide are at an all-time high</li>
<li>Wednesday –Trump unveils a broad tax-cut plan</li>
<li>Thursday – Verizon invests in self-driving car startup Renovo</li>
<li>Friday – Data showed GDP increased at a 0.7% annual rate, below the 1.2% rise estimated by economists</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Our take:</strong><br />
The big news this week is the release of Trump’s tax plan. It’s a big proposal, but it’s more of an opening bid for negotiations to get legislation passed through the House and Senate.  More than likely, this is not the version that will pass, if anything does pass, in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Below are some proposed tax plan highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Repeal the alternative minimum tax (AMT) and the 3.8% Obamacare tax</li>
<li>Cut the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three, with the top rate at 35% vs. the current 39.6%</li>
<li>Chop the corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%</li>
<li>Eliminate tax deductions, keeping only a few exceptions like the mortgage interest and charitable contributions</li>
<li>Eliminate estate tax</li>
<li>Eliminate state and local income tax deductions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some thoughts on the challenges of passing legislation: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bipartisanship isn&#8217;t likely – there are very few indications of Democratic support for the plan</li>
<li>Republicans themselves are divided and even though they don&#8217;t need Democrats to sign on to their plan if they want to &#8220;use the Senate&#8217;s budget reconciliation process to push the legislation through Congress,&#8221; they do need unity in their own party to do so</li>
<li>Lobbyists will either attack or support parts of the plan &#8211; many special interest and trade groups are taking a big interest, from retail to oil, and importers to real estate</li>
<li>The new administration cannot offer any insight currently into how middle-income Americans will fare under Trump’s plan, with many experts saying his plan only supports the rich: a direct contrast to the platform under which Trump ran</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens next</strong><br />
It will be a long road ahead – a lot of basic information is still missing including how much this will cost.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wife and I took a cruise through Europe in the fall of 2013 along the Mediterranean. As we arrived at different ports and visited various cities along the sea, I was floored by how little my dollar went overseas. With a foreign exchange (FX) rate of about $1.40/€, enjoying a €5 gelato while walking the streets of Florence was a $7 experience. Secretly, I hoped to return overseas at a different time when my dollar would go further. </p>
<p>Fast forward to the end of 2016 and the Euro is trading near a 14-year low relative to the USD. Next time I visit Europe I can have the satisfaction of knowing my dollar can go 25% further. It’s almost like everything there is on a 25%-off sale. My $4,500 budget for spending onshore can go as far as $6,000 went in 2013, and I can purchase some gelato at $5.25 instead of the $7 it originally cost and the local vendor is none the wiser. </p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>However, while tourists dream of seeing the value of their dollar go further overseas, that doesn’t come without a price.</p>
</div>
<p>However, while tourists dream of seeing the value of their dollar go further overseas, that doesn’t come without a price. As it turns out, U.S. Investors are exposed to one extra layer of risk when investing internationally: Currency risk. Currency risk is risk that arises from changes in the relative valuation of currencies. So as you order gelato in Italy at 25% off in USD, you will also be “enjoying” that same lower 25% value of your international stock holdings of, say, BP, Nestle, or Novartis.</p>
<h2>Reality Check on International Exposure</h2>
<p>As I logged into my 401k account, I reviewed my year-end balances for 2016. With most major indices worldwide up 10% for 2016, such as the UK Stock Market FTSE 100 (+~17%), Japan’s Nikkei (+~7%) and German DAX (+~11.5%), I expected to see my international exposure up about 10%. What did I find instead? My international holdings were up only 3% for the year! If the funds in my account are designed to be made up of stocks in these international indices that have been up nearly double digits, why were my returns not following along? </p>
<h2>Currency Effect’s Impact on International Goods</h2>
<p>To explain this, let’s imagine that I lived in the UK and to kick off 2016, I purchased shares of BP (a USD investor can buy a single BP ADR, which represents six BP local shares in London). In January 2016, I could have purchased six shares for £21.24, and at year end, the company’s shares would be at £30.576 &#8211; a wonderful one-year return of nearly 44%, not including dividends. Because I live in the United States, however, and my returns are denominated in dollars, I would have purchased those same shares with $31.26 and seen the shares rise to only $37.38 through the same date &#8211; a return of +19.6%, which is a difference of 24.4% for the year. This difference was driven entirely by currency, thanks in large part to the results of the Brexit referendum driving the British Pound to multi-decade lows.</p>
<h2>Hedging Helps Mitigate Risk</h2>
<p>So, why am I cheering for less expensive international goods at the expense of my investment accounts?</p>
<p>Using December 31, 2016, as an end date, over the previous five years, the effects of currency movements on USD returns detracted against performance by 5.32% per year over that time. As a USD investor, my international holdings were up 6.07% annualized over the last five years while a local currency investor would have enjoyed returns of 11.39%. Had a USD investor purchased a currency-hedged product, they would have enjoyed those 11.39% returns.</p>
<p>But if you look at the previous five years before that, currency effects benefited performance by nearly 2% per year over the time. Over the five years prior to that, it added over 6.5% per year. </p>
<h2>Table of Returns*</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Time Horizon</th>
<th>Local Currency Returns</th>
<th>USD Returns</th>
<th>Currency Effect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2011-2016</td>
<td>11.39%</td>
<td>6.07%</td>
<td>-5.32%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2006-2011</td>
<td>-6.04%</td>
<td>-4.09%</td>
<td>1.95%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2001-2006</td>
<td>8.72%</td>
<td>15.25%</td>
<td>6.53%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="4"><em>A strengthening dollar detracts against USD returns; a weakening dollar adds to USD returns</em></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>With the U.S. dollar at a cyclical high, perhaps I could try to mitigate my currency risk through a currency hedged fund. That way, for example, if the UK stock market goes up 10%, my portfolio will go up 10%. But locking in today with the U.S. dollar near a 14-year high is essentially locking in with the value of your international securities at a 14-year low. </p>
<h2>What You Can Do</h2>
<p>No one will ring a bell at the top of the USD strength and no one will ring a bell at the bottom. So what can an investor with a long-time horizon to do? Investors can continue on the same path of investing in international holdings, since the strength of the U.S. dollar is cyclical, appreciating and depreciating over time, as has been very evident over the last 15 years. Oh, yes, and one more thing: for those who invest internationally, cheer for even more expensive vacations abroad.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Market Digest – Week Ending 4/21/2017</em></p>
<p>Stocks rose in a slow news week. Several big financial institutions reported earnings, with mixed results. Many are focused on the French presidential election, which has its first round Sunday. Marine Le Pen, who has called for France’s exit from the Euro, is expected to advance to the second round.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
S&#038;P 500: 2,349 (+0.9%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.6%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.24% (-0.04%)<br />
Gold: $1,284 (-0.2%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.073 (+0.8%)</p>
<p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monday – Big data software company Cloudera indicated it will seek a valuation near $2 billion in an IPO, an amount lower than previous valuations.</li>
<li>Monday – Google bought 1200 acres of land in a private industrial park outside of Reno near the Tesla gigafactory. The company is believed to be planning to build a data center on it.</li>
<li>Tuesday – Uber said it generated $6.5 billion in revenue last year but still lost $2.8 billion.</li>
<li>Tuesday – Post Holdings agreed to buy Weetabix for $1.8 billion.</li>
<li>Wednesday – Morgan Stanley posted stronger than expected earnings, while Goldman Sachs disappointed. In a surprise, Morgan Stanley’s fixed income trading revenue of $1.71 billion surpassed Goldman.</li>
<li>Thursday – Verizon reported its first ever quarterly drop in wireless customers. </li>
<li>Thursday – General Motors exited Venezuela after the government seized its plant.</li>
<li>Friday – The Trump Administration rejected a bid by Exxon Mobile to resume a Black Sea oil venture with sanctioned Russian firm Rosneft.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br />
Our take:</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the most commonly asked question we’ve received over the last five years is “why would you own bonds?” and “what are you doing about rising interest rates?” It is well known that rates have generally fallen over this period despite expectations. But this year rates must be rising, right?</p>
<p>Indeed, at the short end of the curve, the Fed rate increases are having immediate impact. The three-month Treasury yield has increased from .53% to .79%. But the 10-year and 30-year rates are both down for the year, currently sitting at 2.24% and 2.89% respectively. </p>
<p>What does this mean? First it is a good reminder of how hard it is to predict interest rate moves. When rates are low, bonds are not as attractive as when they are higher, but they are still likely to outperform cash in most years and still provide diversification from stocks. Second, it is somewhat bearish for the economy. Traditionally a flatter yield curve (less spread between short and high yield rates) has reduced bank desire to extend credit and indicated lower growth rates ahead. </p>
<p>Most banks are sticking with .01% interest rates on deposits, but a few of the more aggressive online banks are slowly increasing yields on deposits. If you keep a lot of cash parked in the bank it is getting more valuable to shop around for yield. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The road to marriage for same-sex couples is now possible and clear. With all its rights and responsibilities, the road after marriage may be a little less so. As we near the end of another tax season, let’s get some clarity around taxes for same-sex spouses.  </p>
<h2>Married Filing Jointly vs. Married Filing Separately</h2>
<p>For most same-sex spouses, this question on how to file taxes is new <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/2016-tax-brackets" target="_blank">but important</a> because of the risk of incurring the dreaded marriage penalty. The marriage penalty occurs when married couples with similar incomes are bumped into higher tax brackets than when they filed as individuals or if they were to file separately. On the flip side, a marriage bonus can occur when there’s income disparity between spouses that pulls their average incomes into lower tax brackets.</p>
<p>To be sure,<a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2016/03/21/irs-says-95-of-marrieds-file-taxes-jointly-should-you-join-the-5/&#038;refURL=&#038;referrer=#5aa6e5eb2d2c" target="_blank"> most married couples file jointly</a>. However, if one or both of you owe back taxes or child support, either of you has income-based student loan payments, or both of you have high incomes, filing separately may make sense for you. </p>
<p>If you choose to file jointly, you may qualify for tax credits that you couldn’t qualify for if you file separately. These can lower the net total taxes you pay. Some of these credits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/do-i-qualify-for-earned-income-tax-credit-eitc" target="_blank">Earned Income Credit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/education-credits-aotc-llc" target="_blank">Lifetime Learning Credit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc602.html" target="_blank">Child and Dependent Care Credit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8839/ch01.html" target="_blank">Adoption Credit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/aotc" target="_blank">American Opportunity Credit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Filing separately has its benefits, though. There are some deductions that require a percentage of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and are more easily achieved with the lower AGI from filing separately rather than jointly. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income" target="_blank">AGI is the total of all income minus certain deductions</a>. These deductions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969/ar02.html" target="_blank">Self-employed health savings account deductions contributions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-deduction-limits" target="_blank">Contributions to some retirement accounts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch03.html" target="_blank">Investment expenses</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p529/ar02.html" target="_blank">Unreimbursed employee business expenses</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to note that filing separately, however, disqualifies filers from taking some deductions important to younger tax filers, such as the student loan interest or tuition deductions.</p>
<h2>Claiming a Child as a Dependent</h2>
<p>For married couples who file taxes separately, only one spouse per child can claim a child as a dependent. Likewise, if a couple is divorced &#8211;  only one spouse can claim a child as a dependent. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.irs.gov/help-resources/tools-faqs/faqs-for-individuals/frequently-asked-tax-questions-answers/filing-requirements-status-dependents-exemptions/dependents-exemptions/dependents-exemptions-2" target="_blank">According to the IRS</a>, parents may claim their child as a dependent until the child reaches the age of 19, but if the child attends college, then parents may claim that child until he or she reaches 24 years of age (if that child earns less than $3,700 annually). Children who are &#8220;permanently and totally disabled&#8221; or meet the qualifying relative test are an exception to these limits.</p>
<h2>Qualifying for the Adoption Credit</h2>
<p>Many families are blending now that same-sex marriage is legal and, therefore, many queer individuals are bringing their own children into their new families. A common practice is for new spouses to adopt the children their spouses bring into the family.</p>
<p>Adoptions generate expenses, but for both same-sex and opposite sex couples, the IRS does not view the adoption of a spouse’s child as <a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc607.html" target="_blank">qualifying adoption expenses</a> for the Adoption Credit and Adoption Assistance Programs. </p>
<p>If you adopted a child in 2016 who is not your spouse’s child, the maximum qualifying adoption credit for 2016 is $13,460. If your tax credit exceeds your tax liability, you may carry the tax credit forward up to a maximum of five years. The IRS also allows you to exclude employer-provided adoption assistance from your earned income.   </p>
<p>Adoptions eligible for the Adoption Credit and Adoption Assistance Programs are for individuals under age 18 or those “physically or incapable of self-care,” and are subject to income limitations, based on the <a href="https://www.irs.com/articles/what-modified-adjusted-gross-income" target="_blank">Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)</a> and dollar limitations. The income limitation for 2016 begins its phase-out starting at $201,920 and ends at $241,920.</p>
<p>MAGI is your AGI with certain deductions, such as student loan interest and IRA contributions, added back.  </p>
<h2>Retirement Planning</h2>
<p>If retirement savings is a crisis for Americans in general, it’s a <a href="http://corporate.prudential.com/media/managed/PrudentialLGBT2016-2017.pdf" target="_blank">mega-crisis for the queer community </a>specifically. Even though the queer community has disposable income nearing $1 trillion and the <a href="http://www.experian.com/blogs/marketing-forward/2012/07/20/sim-a-look-at-household-income-and-discretionary-spend-of-lesbian-gay-and-heterosexual-americans/" target="_blank">average incomes of both lesbian and gay couples</a> exceed that of our straight peers, queer households tend to only have $6,000 more saved than our straight peers. There could be many reasons for this, but one includes a <a href="http://corporate.prudential.com/view/page/corp/31864" target="_blank">recent study</a> that suggests 48% of the queer community identifies as &#8220;spenders,” while only 32% of the general population does. Therefore, it’s important for queer people to take advantage of all available retirement savings plans. </p>
<p>The IRS now requires qualified retirement plans to treat surviving spouses of same-sex marriages the same as opposite-sex marriages. IRAs, employer-sponsored plans, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/application-of-the-windsor-decision-and-post-windsor-published-guidance-to-qualified-retirement-plans-faqs" target="_blank">must treat the participant&#8217;s spouse as the beneficiary</a>, except when spouses consent to someone else being beneficiaries. The default beneficiary on all retirement accounts, however, only apply to legally married same-sex partners. It does not currently apply to domestic partners or couples in civil unions. </p>
<p>The tax and retirement security benefits of retirement plans should inspire the queer community to address our mega-crisis. Employer-sponsored account contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, which means contributions into these accounts are made before they’re taxed by the IRS. Withdrawals on employer-sponsored accounts are taxed at ordinary income tax rates, which are usually lower for qualified withdrawals made after retirement. In addition, traditional and Roth IRAs can offer various tax benefits depending in your situation.</p>

<h2>Social Security Benefits</h2>
<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/people/same-sexcouples/">recognizes the marriages of same-sex couples</a> in determining Social Security benefit qualification, including Medicare and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Unlike the IRS, the SSA is extending Social Security benefits to some couples in legal, non-marital relationships, such as domestic partnerships and civil unions. If you’re unsure if you qualify for your spouse’s Social Security benefits, contact the SSA directly. </p>
<p>The tax-filing considerations for same-sex spouses are new, but same-sex married couples should feel secure that we and our surviving spouses will be treated by the U.S. government the same as our straight peers. If you or your spouse still have questions, contact your accountant,  your local IRS office or the SSA directly. </p>
<p>Regardless of your marital situation, managing your taxes is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to reaching your long-term goals.<a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank"> Personal Capital’s free tools</a> can help you develop your holistic financial strategy and reach those goals faster.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The end of 2017’s Q1 draws to close a quarter that saw the bull market ushering in its ninth year and politics domestic and abroad impacting markets in the United States and beyond.</p>
<h2>The New Administration &#038; the Markets</h2>
<p>Politics certainly played a starring role in the U.S. market’s direction. Initial policy stumbles by the new administration may have actually contributed to gains as it became evident that Donald Trump will face considerable checks and balances, even within his own party. Most importantly, we know that while President Trump seeks big policy initiatives, most of the economy will continue to move forward much as it did before the election. </p>
<p>Politics aside, however, earnings growth on the corporate front reported from Q4 was more than enough to support the rally, according to FactSet. S&#038;P 500 earnings grew 5% year-over-year and are estimated at 9.1% for Q1, and if met, this would be the highest quarterly growth rate since 2011. More so than politics, this was likely the true driver of a strong Q1. </p>
<h2>Populism in the EU</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/market-news/market-recap-interest-rates-politics-across-europe/" target="_blank">It wasn’t just in the United States</a> where politics took the spotlight, however. After simmering in Europe for years, Populism has gained traction and begun to have a market impact. Many Europeans want to maintain more control of their borders and no longer want trade rules dictated by the EU. The trend is a threat to the EU, and is likely one reason U.S. stocks have outperformed over the past few years. However, this quarter, international stocks outperformed the U.S. Much of this was currency related. The post-election dollar rally partially reversed as it became clear the new administration’s spending plans will face opposition. The euro got a boost in March with the defeat of far-right candidate Geert Wilders in the Netherlands. </p>
<h2>Style Rotations Within Equity Markets</h2>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>Perhaps more so than at any time in this bull market, we think it is important to stay diversified at the sector level.</p>
</div>
<p>Q1 featured a few notable style rotations within equity markets. Energy and communications, two of the best performing sectors last year, were the two worst. As we often say, sector leadership is always cyclical. One year’s biggest winners are frequently the next year’s biggest losers. While the technology sector isn’t nearly as overvalued as it was in 1999, and traditional value sectors are not as overlooked, there are similarities. Perhaps more so than at any time in this bull market, we think it is important to stay diversified at the sector level. </p>
<h2>The Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/might-die-younger-without-fiduciary-rule/" target="_blank">The Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule</a>, originally set to go into effect on April 10, suffered a series of setbacks in the quarter. The rule states that financial professionals working with retirement accounts, including IRAs, must put their client’s best interests first. Right now, there has been a 60-day delay implemented, but the final fate of the rule remains uncertain. Regardless of what happens to the rule, Personal Capital is a Registered Investment Advisor. We have always and will continue to act as a fiduciary and in our clients’ best interests. </p>
<h2>The Fed &#038; Rising Interest Rates</h2>
<p>The Fed stayed on course &#8211; it raised short-term interest rates 0.25% late in Q1 and reiterated an expectation of two more hikes over the remainder of the year. Amid talk of rising interest rates, fear surrounding bonds remains elevated, yet much of it is misguided. Bonds still managed modest gains in this environment.</p>
<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<p>Media and investor focus remains fixated on President Trump and the political landscape. But in our view, the private sector and the broader global economy is likely to be the bigger driver for stocks in the coming years. Despite the gloom-and-doom tone of the election and pockets of geographic weakness, the overall economy is robust and stocks reflect it. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Market Digest – Week Ending 3/24/2017</em><br />
It was a choppy week with global equities falling early, only to jump on Wednesday following the stronger-than-expected ADP National Employment Report. However, gains were short-lived as the recent Fed minutes spooked investors, causing stocks to sell off in the latter hours of the trading day. Treasury yields were relatively flat, while the dollar gained further against the euro. Gold ended the week slightly higher. </p>
<p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
S&#038;P 500: 2,356 (-0.3%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US: (-0.5%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.38% (-0.01%)<br />
Gold: $1,255 (+0.4%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.060 (-0.5%)</p>
<p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monday &#8211; Tesla surpassed Ford in market capitalization, making it the second largest U.S. automaker behind GM</li>
<li>Tuesday – Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, stepped down amidst involvement in a 2012 leak of confidential information</li>
<li>Wednesday – A report from ADP showed the U.S. private sector added a better-than-expected 263,000 jobs in the month of March</li>
<li>Wednesday – The Fed released its latest minutes, showing officials want to start reducing the central bank’s balance sheet later this year</li>
<li>Thursday – In a surprise attack, the U.S. launched close to 60 cruise missiles at an air base in Syria following reports of chemical weapons used by the Assad regime</li>
<li>Friday – After changing the rule on filibusters, the U.S. Senate confirmed Trump-nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our take: </strong><br />
The first quarter of 2017 is now at an end. It was an interesting period, with politics garnering most of the attention. International stocks led asset class returns, followed closely by gold and foreign real estate, while commodities lagged on weakness in energy. We’ll provide a more in-depth review in our quarterly market commentary, which will be released shortly.</p>
<p>But as we start Q2, a familiar face has already recaptured the spotlight: the Federal Reserve. On Wednesday, the Fed released its latest minutes, addressing a long-standing elephant in the room: the central bank’s inflated balance sheet. Officials agreed to start shrinking the $4.5 trillion portfolio later this year, but remained undecided on the pace of the reduction. The news surprised markets, sending stocks sharply lower in afternoon trading. </p>
<p>Despite this, markets stabilized the very next morning, which is a more telling story than the initial knee-jerk reaction. The reduction is widely expected to start with the Fed’s reinvestment policy, where it would stop reinvesting proceeds from maturing securities on its books. Whether it phases this process in or stops reinvestment all at once, the balance sheet would naturally shrink over time. It is also very possible the Fed pauses its rate hike campaign during the initial stages of this reduction to mitigate any economic disruption.  </p>
<p>Full details are still unknown, but again, the likely outcome is a slow and measured reduction of the balance sheet. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been self-employed for over three years now, and while it comes with its perks, it can be stressful having a fluctuating income, managing expenses, and making sure that I handle my business finances effectively. Tax time can be especially trying for self-employed entrepreneurs, especially new ones who may not be familiar with specific tax laws. However, the more educated you become about your taxes, the better you can run your business. </p>
<p>Below are four tax tips that every self-employed entrepreneur should know.</p>
<h2>Keep Those Accounts Separate</h2>
<p>Most entrepreneurs know in theory they should separate their personal checking accounts and their business checking accounts, but sometimes it can be tricky in practice. Even something as simple as forgetting your business credit card when buying office supplies and using your personal credit card instead can throw off your organization and your balances.</p>
<p>John McCarthy, president of <a href="http://johnmccarthycpa.com/" target="_blank">McCarthy Tax Preparation</a>, says separate accounts are also crucial for helping your CPA during tax time. He said, “My biggest tip for entrepreneurs is to keep a separate checking and credit card account to make year-end tax preparation easier. If all your income and expenses are separated from your personal finances, both you and your CPA will have a much easier time in April when you are looking for those last few deductions.”</p>
<p>Don’t forget that you often pay your accountant based on the time it takes him or her to complete your returns. So, the more disorganized and complicated your accounts are, the longer it will take them to sort through everything.</p>
<h2>Don’t Forget About Quarterly Taxes</h2>
<p>Generally, self-employed entrepreneurs have to file an annual return and pay <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/self-employed#QuarterlyPayments" target="_blank">estimated quarterly taxes</a>, which means that you should be paying taxes all year round. If you don’t, you could be facing a huge tax bill. In fact, it’s the tip accountant <a href="http://notyourdadscpa.com/" target="_blank">Mark Tew</a> recommends the most. He says, “Don&#8217;t put your accountant or CPA in that awkward position of telling you that you owe $20,000-plus in penalties. Pay your quarterly estimated taxes!”</p>
<p>To make things easier, I consult with my accountant at the end of every quarter. We go over the amount I have to send in and make sure everything is on track. Although it definitely hurts to send in big chunks of money to the IRS four times a year, it does help keep things organized and prevents large surprise tax bills in April.</p>
<h2>Know What’s an Expense and What Isn’t</h2>
<p>I sure love business expenses, and I regularly ask my accountant what I’m allowed to deduct. Just recently I asked him if I could deduct clothing purchases if they were used towards a blog campaign (he said no!). </p>
<p>I know I’m not the only one who does this. In fact, my accountant <a href="http://accountlancer.com/" target="_blank">Eric Nisall</a> said it’s very important for entrepreneurs to know that “certain items aren&#8217;t ‘business expenses,’” such as owner draws, self-employed health insurance premiums, and 50% of meals, yet people incorrectly calculate their net incomes with those figures taken out and end up grossly underpaying their estimates.”</p>
<p>If you have a question about a business expense or how much you’re allowed to claim, whether it’s your home office or your favorite drink at Starbucks while you work, be sure to ask your accountant ahead of time so you don’t get a surprise when it comes to your tax bill.</p>
<p>[Don’t forget that tracking your expenses is just as important in your personal life as it is for your business. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">Use our free tools</a> to easily manage your entire financial life in one secure place.]</p>
<h2>Take Advantage of Retirement Accounts</h2>
<p>Although entrepreneurs grumble about self-employment taxes, there is one huge benefit they have above the traditional work force: some nice retirement account perks. </p>
<p>According to accountant John McCarthy, “One of the biggest benefits for entrepreneurs is the availability of Solo 401k’s and SEP IRAs to save for retirement. Some taxpayers can sock away as much as $53,000 into their retirement accounts and help to reduce their federal tax liability.” He also advises entrepreneurs to consider setting up a savings account early in the year and setting aside a small amount of earnings from revenue as they earn it. </p>
<h2>Organization and Preparation</h2>
<p>Ultimately, when it comes to tax time for those who are self-employed, it really comes down to organization and preparation. If you spend all your business income without setting aside money for taxes, tax time will be very stressful for you. If you don’t double check your business expenses, especially unusual ones, with your accountant, you could owe more than you originally thought. And, if you mix your personal and business accounts, it can be hard to know how much your business makes every year and what you spend to keep it running. </p>
<p>Don’t forget that monitoring your personal accounts is just as important as keeping tabs on your business. You can use <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">Personal Capital’s free tools</a> to track you whole financial life in one secure place.</p>
<p>The best way to stay organized is to start early and be conservative with your quarterly estimates. If you save all year long and pay taxes every quarter, you will not only have a more intimate knowledge of your business finances, but you’ll also be on track to save, invest, and grow your business year after year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Market Digest – Week Ending 3/31/2017</em></p>
<p>U.S. stocks closed mixed this Friday and the Nasdaq had the best quarter since 2013. Strong economic data and the possibility of fiscal stimulus under President Donald Trump have driven U.S. equities to record highs since his election. Economic data around GDP growth, jobless claims, commerce department inflation numbers, and consumer confidence levels were announced this week. </p>
<p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
S&#038;P 500: 2,362.72 (+1.44%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.20%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.39% (-0.02%)<br />
Gold: $1,250.60 (+0.3%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.065 (+0.13%)</p>
<p><strong>Major Events:</strong><br />
• Monday – TransCanada’s Keystone XL Project received permission from the Trump administration to continue construction work<br />
• Tuesday – Consumer confidence levels soared to their highest level in 16 years.<br />
• Wednesday – U.K. Triggers article 50 to begin formal negotiations to leave the European Union (EU)<br />
• Thursday – The final look at 4Q Gross Domestic Product showed a quarter-over-quarter (q/q) annualized rate of growth of 2.1%, adjusted up from the 1.9% expansion<br />
• Friday – Commerce Department report pointed to the biggest annual increase in inflation in nearly five years </p>
<p><strong>Our take:</strong><br />
As we kick off spring cleaning plans this year, make sure to get organized. Things change, sometimes often and sudden. It’s important to have your financial information in one place so it can be easier to deal with the unexpected – good and bad. Here is a list of items and documents that you should have easily accessible. </p>
<p><strong>Key Contacts:</strong><br />
1. Family member’s names and contact information<br />
2. Primary care Physician<br />
3. Financial Advisor<br />
4. Trust Attorney<br />
5. Accountant<br />
6. Dentist<br />
7. Veterinarian</p>
<p><strong>Personal Documentation:</strong><br />
1. Social Security card<br />
2. Birth Certificate<br />
3. Passport<br />
4. Marriage certificate<br />
5. Safe and Combination<br />
6. Safe deposit box and key</p>
<p><strong>Personal item ownership:</strong><br />
1. Real Estate<br />
2. Car or motor vehicle title<br />
3. Any other titles of ownership </p>
<p>Set up a basic file with the key contact information and place it in drawer. You can leave instructions on where you have placed your personal documentation and ownership. Make sure to tell your key contacts where you put the file.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like New Year diets and birthday cakes, there are some things we should try to incorporate into our lives every year. Whether it’s for fun, fitness or our finances, we usually end up better off because of them. And it’s often helpful to have firm, recurring dates to prompt us to think about these things. For example, tax season comes every year and can serve as a great reminder to exercise some good financial habits. </p>
<p>Now that we’re in the heart of yet another tax season, here are five money moves you can develop to improve your finances and peace of mind.</p>
<h2>Confirm Your Portfolio Allocation</h2>
<p>Buy and hold is a passive investment strategy (unlike an active one, like day trading) in which investors hold positions for a long time regardless of the ups and downs of the market. For investors who exercise this type of investment strategy, tax season is a perfect reminder to rebalance their portfolios. </p>
<p>Even though buy-and-hold investors aren’t actively trading, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t review their accounts to maintain proper portfolio allocations. Different markets, such as large cap and international investments, as two examples, don’t move in tandem. Therefore, buy-and-hold investors should adjust their portfolio allocations to stay in line with pre-established risk tolerances, time horizons, and investment objectives and goals.</p>
<h2>Confirm Your Beneficiaries</h2>
<p>You should think about confirming the beneficiaries on your investment accounts annually. Beneficiary designations supersede instructions in wills, which is a technicality that catches many by surprise. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, many forget to change their beneficiaries as their relationships change. If you leave your ex-partner or ex-spouse as a beneficiary on your investment accounts, they have the legal right to the assets in those accounts when you pass away. Your will designating your current partner or spouse as the heir does not supersede beneficiary designations you assigned prior to your current relationship. </p>
<p>Cases come up too frequently that <a href="http://familylawyermagazine.com/articles/beneficiary-designations" target="_blank">could have been avoided had a deceased partner updated the beneficiary information</a>. For this reason, verify and update your beneficiaries as necessary every year and use the tax season as a reminder. </p>
<h2>Confirm Your Power of Attorney</h2>
<p>Each year, you should double check your financial and medical powers of attorney. A financial power of attorney designates an agent to manage your financial matters, whereas a medical power of attorney designates someone to manage your medical needs.  </p>
<p>Financial and medical powers of attorney both allow for standard durable powers of attorney or springing powers of attorney. A standard durable power of attorney authorizes an agent to, immediately upon authorization, act on your behalf, including if you become temporarily or permanently incompetent or incapacitated. This type of authorization ceases when you pass away. </p>
<p>Springing powers of attorney, on the other hand, authorize an agent to act on your behalf only if certain conditions are met, typically if you become permanently incapacitated, as determined by a medical doctor. It, too, ceases when you pass away. </p>
<p>Because such agent powers carry heavy responsibilities, confirm the appropriateness of each agent each year when you file your taxes.</p>
<h2>Check Your Credit Report</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/financial-planning-2/3-ways-wealthy-people-leverage-their-credit/" target="_blank">Creating good credit habits</a>, protecting yourself from identity theft, and keeping tabs on your credit score can feel like a full-time job. With systems in places, though, it’s a little easier.</p>
<p>Review all your credit card, debit card, bank, and investment account statements regularly to confirm nothing untoward happens from month-to-month. If you see negative or inaccurate transactions, contact your respective financial services firm immediately. </p>

<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>An added layer of protection for your credit score is to review your credit report annually. This is an opportunity to contest or clean up inaccurate items on your credit report, and to confirm you didn’t miss anything in your month-to-month reviews.</p>
</div>
<p>An added layer of protection for your credit score is to review your credit report annually. This is an opportunity to contest or clean up inaccurate items on your credit report, and to confirm you didn’t miss anything in your month-to-month reviews.</p>
<p>Consumers are entitled to one free credit report a year from each of the three credit rating agencies, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Rather than contacting all three credit rating agencies yearly, simply go to <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> to request your free credit report from each agency all at once when you file your taxes.  </p>
<h2>Confirm Your Emergency Contact Information</h2>
<p>If you haven’t already done so, create a list of important contacts with their contact information. This will help your family should you become incompetent or incapacitated. Every year when you file your taxes, update this list for accuracy. This list should include, but not be limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attorneys</li>
<li>Accountants</li>
<li><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">Financial advisors</a></li>
<li>Doctors</li>
<li>Executors</li>
<li>Power of attorneys</li>
<li>Spouse</li>
<li>Children</li>
<li>Parents</li>
<li>Siblings</li>
<li>Heirs</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies such as <a href="https://www.docubank.com/" target="_blank">Docubank</a> and <a href="https://www.carbonite.com/" target="_blank">Carbonite for Home</a> let you electronically store this and other legal documents, such as healthcare directives and emergency medical information, so they’re stored in a safe and easily accessible location. This will make it much easier for your family and/or heirs to manage the more important financial initiatives should they need to.</p>
<p>It can sometimes be hard to maintain important aspects of our finances without having systems in place, especially those that are often overlooked or forgotten. By implementing a system to regularly address these important topics, you can build your way to a stronger financial future and a more peaceful state of mind.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you hear the one about Melvin? He turned a would-be million-dollar windfall into a $120,000 un-payable tax debt. It would be funny, if it wasn’t so sad — and so very avoidable.</p>
<p>Here’s Melvin’s story: He is a smart guy who works hard at a successful start-up technology company named Flooble. As a reward for his efforts, Melvin is granted 100,000 stock options at $1 per share. When Flooble’s stock hits $15 a share, Melvin exercises his options, generating a $1.4 million paper profit. However, at a 30% tax rate, Melvin’s paper profit also comes with a $420,000 real tax bill. Marvin is confident that Flooble will continue growing briskly, so instead of cashing out, he holds Flooble’s stock for another year. Then the scandal hits. Flooble’s shares plummet to $3 per share. Melvin is left with just $300,000 in stock assets, but he still owes $420,000 to the IRS and is unable to pay. So sad, but Melvin could have dodged this disaster if he had exercised better planning before he exercised his options. (By the way, don’t worry too much about Melvin &#8211; he’s fictional. We used him to make a point because this scenario can be very real for those with poor planning.)</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>There are many different agreements and forms of options, each with unique characteristics and tax ramifications.</p>
</div>
<p>Companies who grant stock options typically give employees and other affiliated workers the option to buy company stock at a specified price after a predetermined vesting period. Generally, a percentage of options vest each year over a three-to-five-year period. There are many different agreements and forms of options, each with unique characteristics and tax ramifications. Consulting a tax advisor before you exercise your options is recommended.</p>
<p>Two common forms of stock options are non-statutory options (NSOs) and statutory options, which are also known as incentive stock options (ISOs). NSOs are taxed as ordinary income when they are exercised. The amount subject to ordinary income tax is the difference between the fair-market value at the time of exercise and the exercise price. In Melvin’s case, for example, his exercise price was $1 per share and the stock was selling for a fair-market value of $15, so he made $14 per share &#8211; and taxes were due immediately on that gain. If Flooble’s stock had continued to rise, Melvin would have also owed capital gains taxes on any profits above $15 per share, but not until he sold the stock. Because you, like Melvin, will generate a real tax bill when you exercise NSOs, selling all the shares you exercise will avoid risk from the stock depreciating significantly as well as an ill-timed tax liability. </p>
<p>ISOs, which are usually granted to employees, are not taxed at the grant date or the exercise date, but only when the shares are sold. However, if you wish to qualify for favorable tax treatment, you must hold the shares two years from grant and one year from exercise. This is called a “qualified disposition.” If the stock has continued to rise during that period, you’ll only owe long-term capital gains when you sell. However, you may still be required to put up a sizeable amount of cash upon exercise (depending on the strike price). And if you continue to hold onto the shares, the stock’s value could just as easily fall, erasing any gains. (Think Melvin.) There are also some rules to follow or you risk losing some of the advantages ISOs offer. Additionally, you must contend with the potential of triggering the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for the year you exercise these options. These are just some of the reasons you should seek professional advice and put a plan in place before exercising stock options. </p>
<p>In addition to NSOs and ISOs, there are tax rules surrounding Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) and Restricted Stock Units/Awards (RSUs/RSAs). These types of equity compensation can have some complications, but may be easier to deal with if you have the right strategy in place.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Market Digest – Week Ending 3/24/2017</em><br />
Despite increasing in the latter half of the week, U.S. stocks were unable to fully recover from Tuesday’s sharp decline. All attention was on politics as House Republicans tried to muster enough support to replace the Affordable Care Act. Markets reacted with initial skepticism, worrying a failed health care vote would cast doubt on the new administration’s ability to pass other policies. Foreign developed stocks ended the week slightly down, while emerging markets, U.S. bonds and gold all posted gains. The dollar weakened. </p>
<p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
S&#038;P 500: 2,344 (-1.3%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US: (-0.3%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.41% (-0.09%)<br />
Gold: $1,246 (+1.4%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.080 (+0.6%)</p>
<p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monday – First day of spring</li>
<li>Tuesday – Apple unveiled a new iPad for $329 in an effort to combat lower priced offerings from competitors</li>
<li>Wednesday – U.S. existing home sales fell 3.7% in February from the previous month, primarily due to tight inventory and rising prices </li>
<li>Wednesday – A terror attack in London left four four dead and injured over 50, according to latest reports. The attacker was killed onsite</li>
<li>Thursday – House Republicans delayed a vote to replace the Affordable Care Act on fears it lacked the necessary support to pass </li>
<li>Friday – Amidst further uncertainty, House Republicans pulled their healthcare bill in the final minutes before the vote.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our take:</strong><br />
Monday’s vernal equinox marked the start of a new season, and with that comes the annual tradition: spring cleaning. But don’t think this only applies to your closets and garage—there is something much more important to attend to: your finances. Now is as good a time as any to clean things up and make sure you’re on the right track. Here are a few basic steps to take: </p>
<ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a plan.</strong> You’ve heard it all before. People are much more likely to accomplish goals with a plan than without. So what is yours? Are you saving the right amount for retirement? What about college for your children? A new home purchase? Don’t let yourself suffer from “analysis paralysis.” It’s easy to be overwhelmed by these decisions and give up, choosing to maintain the status quo. But by having a proper plan in place, you’ll know exactly where to focus your efforts so none of your goals are neglected.</li>
<li><strong>Out with the old.</strong> Yep, it’s time to tidy up. Do you have any concentrated positions you’ve been hanging onto? Depending on your tax situation, now could be a good time to diversify. You may also have a number of old 401k’s out there, each with a different set of investments. You could even be paying excessive fees by keeping your money there. Make things easier on yourself and consider rolling those 401k’s into a single IRA. This will consolidate everything into one place and give you total control over investment choices.</li>
<li>In with the new. Once you’ve cleaned house and organized, it’s time to execute your plan. In other words, make sure the appropriate accounts are set up and start saving. You’ll also need to review your overall asset allocation and make sure it’s appropriate for your specific goals and financial situation. It should be diversified globally and across multiple asset classes.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<p>Not sure how much to save, or what allocation you should use for your investments? <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">Try the Personal Capital Financial Dashboard.</a> It’s free and is a great first step to cleaning up your finances. And if you need a more customized approach, consider hiring a professional &#8211; just be careful. Many professionals disguise themselves as “financial planners” when in fact they’re just brokers paid on commission. Always make sure to ask how they’re compensated so you’re aware of any conflicts of interest. </p>
<p>Happy cleaning! </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Selecting the best assets for your investment accounts can be confusing and intimidating. There are many options, which can have radically different tax implications, so it’s often best to know which ones are the most efficient to narrow your choices to a smaller, manageable list.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking that you’ll just take the most tax-efficient assets and be done with it, you’ll find that it’s not quite that simple. There are tradeoffs to consider. For example, you may need to sacrifice some tax efficiency to achieve a well-diversified portfolio. </p>
<p>To begin your journey, here is some high-level information on investment options and their corresponding tax efficiency: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individual stocks:</strong> When properly managed, holding individual stocks can be the most tax-efficient way to gain exposure to equities because you are entirely in control of when you realize gains or losses. You may, however, owe taxes on dividends, if you purchase dividend-paying stocks. </li>
<li><strong>Exchange traded funds (ETFs):</strong> One of the primary advantages of ETFs is their tax efficiency compared to active mutual funds. This is mostly because they are passively managed, which results in lower turnover. Another advantage of ETFs is that they trade like stock on the secondary market and they are structured for easy purchase and redemption.</li>
<li><strong>Mutual funds:</strong> These funds, when held in taxable accounts, can create excessive annual tax bills because of their high turnover rates. Except for some passively managed funds, mutual funds generally have lots of turnover because active managers are trying to beat fund benchmarks. This frequent buying and selling creates tax issues. In addition, mutual funds make periodic (mostly annual) distributions, which are also subject to taxes. A 2010 study by Lipper indicated that owners of mutual funds in taxable accounts gave up an average of 0.98% to 2.08% in annual return to taxes over a 10-year period<a href="http://www.rssing.com/account.php?a=ssm&#038;r=o6&#038;u=http%3A%2F%2Flipper46.rssing.com%2Fbrowser.php%3Findx%3D5113768%26last%3D1%26item%3D39" title="Jump to Footnotes at end of page"><sup>1</sup></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Passive bond mutual funds and bond ETFs are generally more tax efficient than actively managed bond funds, but come with some other tax considerations. Income generated from these funds is taxed as ordinary income. There are exceptions, such as municipal bonds, which can be tax advantaged. If you live in the state in which they are issued, you are exempt from state tax in addition to the federal income tax on these bonds. While this sounds good, municipal bonds often pay lower returns. Generally, those in high tax brackets benefit the most from municipal bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs):</strong> Unlike private REITs, which can provide diversification but are usually illiquid, ETF REITs are an efficient portfolio diversifier because they allow you to gain exposure to real estate through an instrument that is liquid. Additionally, investors do not have required maintenance and upkeep responsibilities for the properties held in a REIT. However, a REIT (ETF or private) must pay out at least 90% of its income annually in the form of dividends, which are generally taxed as ordinary income.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, each asset offers tax advantages and disadvantages. While each of these categories appears to offer straightforward tax options, there are numerous other nuances to consider, which should be considered in the context of the tax implications of the individual asset before you decide on a basket of assets for your investment accounts. Your <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">financial advisor</a> can help you review and choose a tax efficient strategy.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times piece “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/business/dealbook/banks-and-tech-firms-battle-over-something-akin-to-gold-your-data.html?_r=1" target="_blank">Banks and Tech Firms Battle Over Something Akin to Gold: Your Data</a>” calls attention to a battle that is raging behind the scenes of nearly every consumer in the United States. The contenders? Big Banks and Silicon Valley tech startups. What’s the prize? Your personal financial data.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/bill-harris-former-ceo-intuit-calls-baloney-j-p-morgan-intuit/" target="_blank">As we’ve mentioned before</a>, Big Banks such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan are pushing to restrict technology companies’ access to personal financial data, which ranges from what you paid for dinner to what your mortgage is. Tech companies, such as Personal Capital, believe that these restrictions aren’t in the interest of security – as the Big Banks claim – but instead are created to limit competition from the tech industry.</p>
<p>As Bill Harris, our CEO says in the piece, “It’s pretty clear the real intent of the banks is to limit this data because it puts their business model at risk.”</p>
<p>Personal Capital users <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">link their financial accounts in one dashboard</a> for a holistic view of their financial lives. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">Our advisors</a> can then give personal, technology-enhanced guidance to help clients achieve their long-term financial goals. </p>
<p>“We suss out the data and show the customer what they are actually paying,” Harris says in the NYT piece. “From a business model point of view, that is not in the best interest of the banks and brokers. It’s encouraging customers to get smart and get well-priced products.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/business/dealbook/banks-and-tech-firms-battle-over-something-akin-to-gold-your-data.html?_r=1" target="_blank">Read the full New York Times article here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have multiple investments, do you consider the most appropriate account for each of your assets? If not, you should. Each of your accounts has unique tax characteristics, and if you understand these characteristics, you can place your assets in the most advantageous accounts, thereby minimizing your tax liabilities. </p>
<p>This concept is called <strong>tax location</strong>. The benefits of tax location have been well-catalogued, with studies pointing to a boost of 20-plus basis points per year on average. This means more money in your pockets without any change to your asset mix; it all comes from simply paying attention to which account you use for each asset.</p>
<h2>Account Types</h2>
<p>There are essentially three main types of investment accounts: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxable: </strong>Gains are taxed in the year they were earned, e.g. individual, joint, custodial, and trusts</li>
<li><strong>Tax-deferred:</strong> Pre-tax money is contributed to these accounts, with taxes due on principal or earnings when they are withdrawn, e.g. 401k, IRAs (SEP, Simple, Traditional)</li>
<li><strong>Tax-exempt:</strong> After-tax money is contributed to these accounts. Earnings and dividends accrue tax free (subject to early withdrawal restrictions), e.g. Roth IRA/401k, HSA (when used for health expenses), and 529 plans</li>
</ul>
<p>Since each of these accounts is treated very differently from a tax perspective, it makes sense to consider the tax sensitivity of each asset before you assign it to your accounts. </p>
<h2>Asset Types</h2>
<p>There are two key facts that generally determine the tax burden associated with an asset. The first is the nature of the asset’s gains &#8211; are they classified as capital gains, dividends or income? The second factor is the size of the returns. Here are some asset-type examples: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equities:</strong> Gains in stocks held one year or longer are taxed at a preferential long-term rate. Short-term gains and non-qualified equity dividends are taxed as ordinary income. <em>Long-term holdings are tax efficient, but short-term holdings are tax inefficient.</em></li>
<li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Taxes on bond capital gains are the same as for equities, but interest payments are taxed as ordinary income. The actual tax paid depends on the type of bond. <em>Bonds can be either tax inefficient or tax efficient depending on the type of bond.</em></li>
<li><strong>REITs:</strong> The IRS requires REITs to pay out at least 90% of their income to shareholders every year to avoid taxation at the corporate level. For the most part, these payouts are taxed as ordinary income. <em>REITs are tax inefficient.</em></li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Commodity funds fall into two basic categories: 1. Those that hold physical assets like precious metals, and 2. Those that own futures contracts to track commodity prices. Precious metal investments are considered “collectables” and are taxed at a higher capital gains rate. Funds that hold futures are usually structured as limited partnerships and taxed at a combination of long- and short-term rates. They also are taxed on unrealized gains annually. <em>Many commodity funds are tax inefficient.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>General Allocation Rules</h2>
<p>So how do you allocate these very different assets? </p>
<p>Optimizing around long-term growth rates and tax rates can get very complicated. But to save money immediately, there are two general rules: </p>
<ul>
<ol>
<li>
Assets with high expected income and inefficient taxing should be assigned to tax-deferred or tax-exempt accounts.</li>
<li>
Assets with low expected income and efficient taxing should be assigned to a taxable account.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<p>At Personal Capital, <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">our financial advisors</a> automatically direct client purchases of high-yielding tax-inefficient assets, such as REITs and high yield bonds, to available IRA accounts. More tax-efficient assets, such as equities, are assigned to a taxable brokerage account. This combination of sheltered earnings and tax-efficient growth may result in a smaller tax bill and more money available for your retirement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The impact of efficient tax management within investing is substantial. Tax management just within the domain of investing can increase your portfolio’s return by 1% per year. Invested over 35 years, that can lead to a 40% difference in the value of your portfolio<a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/assets/whitepapers/Personal_Capital_Investment_Strategy.pdf" title="Jump to Footnotes at end of page"><sup>1</sup></a>. Proper tax management can help increase the amount of money in your pockets, which ultimately increases the long-term chance of achieving your financial and life goals.</p>
<p>The next installments of our Personal Capital Tax Series focus on how you might approach taxes in the realm of investing to increase the money in your pockets, and ultimately increase the chance of achieving your financial goals.</p>
<h1>Taxes &#038; Capital Gains</h1>
<p>You’ve probably heard of capital gains taxes. You owe these taxes only if you realize a profit from the sale of an investment or business. Before you pocket your windfall, you must share some of it with Uncle Sam. While that doesn’t sound too bad, wouldn’t it be better if you could decrease the share that you must pay and increase what you keep?</p>
<h2>Long-Term vs. Short-Term Investments</h2>
<p>The amount of taxes you will pay on your realized capital gains differs greatly depending on how long you owned your asset. For example, let’s say you owned a stock for less than one year &#8211; you’ll owe taxes based on your ordinary income tax bracket. If you owned the stock for more than a year, on the other hand, you’ll pay a lower long-term capital gains tax rate, which can be anywhere from 0% to 20%, depending on your tax bracket. If you earn more than $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married), you will be subject to an additional 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax. </p>
<p>That’s why most investors should focus on buying investments they plan to hold for at least one year; in most cases, capital gains taxes owed will be significantly less on long-term gains than they are on short-term gains.  </p>
<h2>Tax Loss Harvesting</h2>
<p>But there is another way to manage capital gains taxes: through tax-loss harvesting. Essentially, you sell some of your losses to offset your gains. Typically, tax-loss harvesting works best through portfolios of individual stocks in taxable investment accounts. You sell stocks within your portfolio that have dropped in value, and ideally, you sell enough stocks that have lost value to cover the amount of appreciation from the stocks you are selling for a gain. You can even offset up to $3,000 in other income if your capital losses exceed your capital gains. Tax loss harvesting can help you rebalance your stock portfolio at the same time, and can result in a higher net after-tax return. </p>
<p>Tax-loss harvesting works even if you want to maintain exposure to the stocks that have lost value, but there are some rules. To avoid the “wash sale” rule, you cannot repurchase the same or a substantially identical stock within 30 days before or after selling at a loss. You can, however, buy an exchange traded fund (ETF) covering the broad market and hold it during the wash-sale period. This allows you to maintain exposure to the industry until you can repurchase the stocks you sold. If the security you sold was a basket of stocks, such as an ETF, you cannot simply buy the same type of ETF from another provider. Tax loss harvesting can be complex, so consulting a financial and tax advisor is recommended.</p>
<p>We routinely use this method to help most clients offset all capital gains and even hit the $3,000 maximum deduction amount. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">Schedule an appointment with a Personal Capital advisor</a> to find out more.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From April to June last year, <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/2016/09/more-than-1-billion-airline-baggage-fees-q2/" target="_blank">airline baggage fees added up to more than $1 billion for U.S. airlines</a>. What exactly does that have to do with your taxes? Well, if you travel for work and can deduct your airline ticket, you can also deduct those baggage fees. </p>
<p>Every dollar counts when it comes to taxes. Even though many IRS deductions and credits are relatively small amounts individually, they can add up to substantial savings for those taxpayers who diligently track their costs and understand deductions and credits. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">[Use our free tools to easily track all your personal finances]</a></p>
<p>Here are a few more IRS deductions and credits that are often overlooked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State sales tax:</strong> Did you know you can choose to deduct either state income tax or state sales tax. That’s important if you live in a state that doesn’t have a state income tax. It’s also important if you make a large purchase, such as a car, boat or recreational vehicle, and you usually just deduct your state income tax. For that one year, you might want to deduct your state sales tax, instead. Just do the math and pick the most favorable result.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign tax credits:</strong> Don’t skip this one, especially not if you own mutual funds. Your 1099 forms might reveal that you are paying more foreign taxes than you imagined—particularly if you imagined that you were paying none.</li>
<li><strong>Child care credit:</strong> Even if you pay for childcare with pre-tax dollars, you may be able to claim a credit for some childcare costs exceeding the $5,000 maximum for your pre-tax plan.</li>
<li><strong>Job-hunting costs:</strong> If you are looking for a job in your same line of work, track your expenses. If you itemize, you can deduct all sorts of expenses, such as printing costs for resumes, postage, food, lodging for out-of-town searches, and many more associated costs. They will need to be over 2% of your AGI to be able to deduct them.</li>
<li><strong>Moving expenses for a new job or job location:</strong> Did you move more than 50 miles away to take a new job? You can cut your tax bill by deducting reasonable moving expenses. And, you don’t need to itemize to benefit from these deductions.</li>
<li><strong>Military reserve travel expenses:</strong> If you are a member of the military reserve or National Guard, you can deduct several expenses associated with your commitment. This is another deduction you can take even if you don’t itemize deductions.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s lots more to know about each of these tax deductions and credits, as well as how taxes impact all aspects of your life, from retirement to education savings.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you could purchase one product that promised to give you a steady income for life and take the worry out of outliving your assets, would you jump at the chance? While it sounds like an easy decision, this type of product, called an annuity, may not be appropriate for everyone.</p>
<p>An annuity is an insurance contract that is typically used to provide a guaranteed income for life. In the world of finance, however, “guarantees” usually carry hefty price tags, and annuities are no exception. You should fully understand the pros and cons of this product before you decide whether an annuity is right for your investment portfolio. (It may be in your best interest to <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">consult a fiduciary financial advisor</a> before purchasing one of these.)</p>
<h2>Types of Annuities</h2>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>There are many different types of annuities that come with myriad options, riders, disclaimers, footnotes and contingencies.</p>
</div>
<p>There are many different types of annuities that come with myriad options, riders, disclaimers, footnotes and contingencies. A financial professional can comb through all the details to help avoid any big pitfalls, as they do get very complicated. Make sure the person you are speaking with is a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management/advisors" target="_blank">true financial advisor</a> and not and insurance representative.</p>
<p>The two basic types of annuities are immediate annuities and deferred annuities. An immediate annuity will begin providing an immediate income stream, but you’ll need a lump sum up front to pay for this product. A deferred annuity is more commonly sold to investors who are saving for a future retirement. </p>
<h2>Annuity Subtypes</h2>
<p>The income you receive depends on the annuity subtypes you choose. Three common options are <strong>fixed annuities</strong>, <strong>variable annuities</strong>, and <strong>indexed annuities</strong>. </p>
<p>If you own a fixed annuity, the insurance company sets a fixed interest rate that is paid on the money you put into it. A variable annuity means money will be split into sub-accounts (depending on your risk level) and invested in stocks, bonds and other investments. In both cases the level of your income depends on the value of the annuity once you start to annuitize. In a fixed annuity, your income will not likely change; in a variable annuity, your income will have a minimum amount and could potentially increase if the sub-accounts perform well. (In many cases this doesn’t happen because the sub-accounts would have to outperform what you withdraw as well as the costs of the annuity.) </p>
<p>Indexed annuities are a cousin of the variable annuities, but their performance is linked to an index and they usually force you to hold on the annuity for a longer period. </p>
<h2>Annuity Advantages</h2>
<p>For risk-averse investors, annuities can be reassuring. Locking in an income stream and skipping the worry of outliving your assets is appealing to many. You can also make unlimited contributions, unlike tax-advantaged retirement accounts. </p>
<h2>Annuity Disadvantages</h2>
<p>There are many drawbacks to annuities. Some of these include the fact that annuities are costly; the list of fees associated with them is lengthy. You usually face penalties if you withdraw money early. Additionally, annuity earnings are taxed as ordinary income when you start drawing payments, which could be a significant issue depending on your future retirement income level. </p>
<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that by buying an annuity, you are signing a contract with an insurance company to make payments for a period of time or for your lifetime. The insurance company can make changes to the interest they pay, returns, investment options and payouts. Locking your money up for a long time will take away flexibility and it’s important to think through what your true needs are. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Market Digest – Week Ending 3/24/2017</em><br />
The Fed returned to the spotlight this week, raising short-term interest rates by 0.25% as was widely expected. While highly subject to change, forward-looking statements implied the Fed intends to stick with a previously articulated schedule of three total hikes for 2017. Many expected language suggesting faster tightening, leading to a decline in interest rates and the dollar. Stocks were relatively flat. International stocks outperformed, largely driven by currency. In a reversal of the trend so far this year, the biggest stocks lagged while small caps made up ground. Election results in the Netherlands pointed to slowing momentum for populist leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
S&#038;P 500: 2,378 (+0.2%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US: (+2.2%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.50% (-0.07%)<br />
Gold: $1,229 (+2.0%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.074 (+0.7%)</p>
<p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday – Intel announced at $15 billion acquisition of Israeli Mobileye, a leader in vehicle automation technology</li>
<li>Wednesday – High-speed trading firm Virtu offered to acquire rival KCG Holdings for about $1.3 billion</li>
<li>Wednesday – The Fed raised short term interest rates by 0.25% and suggested it remains on track for two more hikes this year</li>
<li>Thursday – Peabody Energy, the world’s largest private coal producer, said it expects to exit bankruptcy in April pending a plan to restructure debt</li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; Geert Wilders’ far right party won 20 seats in an election of the Netherlands, fewer than had been expected</li>
<li>Thursday – The SEC said indicated it is likely to reduce settlement periods for common equities from three days to two</li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; Trump released his first budget blueprint, outlining increases to defense spending and cuts to most agencies including steep cuts to the EPA and State Department</li>
<li>Friday – U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said military action would be “on the table” against North Korea if it threatens South Korean or U.S. interests</li>
<li>Friday – The Justice Department filed a case arguing the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unconstitutional</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our take:</strong><br />
The Netherlands was first to the polls in a series of important 2017 elections in Europe. Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s center-right party emerged with more support than expected while far right candidate Geert Wilders’ party had less than was expected.</p>
<p>Even as Great Britain moves toward exiting the EU, the result provided a relief for traditional supporters of the EU and of globalism in general. Still, the surge of support for isolationist views is far from over. Much of the focus has so far been on French elections to be held in April and Germany in September. Like the UK, the United States and the Netherlands, the outcome is impossible to predict and the polls are highly unreliable. Equity markets had a modest positive initial reaction to the Dutch election, but as we’ve seen with recent outcomes, market reaction is fickle and also hard to predict. </p>
<p>Whatever happens in France, the fate of the EU and the direction of Europe in general will be decided over multiple years and will depend on many variables. The Greek debt crisis, which has been dormant for a couple of years, is not yet solved. If you are a supporter of the EU, it was a good week, but the longer trend still suggests turbulence. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s no question about it: education is expensive. <a href="http://www.collegedata.com/cs/content/content_payarticle_tmpl.jhtml?articleId=10064" target="_blank">A recent survey</a> found that a “moderate” college budget for a public school (in-state) averaged nearly $25,000 for the academic year. It’s never too early to start thinking about this important financial topic – and there are ways you can leverage education costs to lower your tax bill.</p>
<h2>College Savings With a 529 Plan</h2>
<p>A 529 plan is a state-sponsored plan used for saving toward a college education. This type of plan has the potential to lower your state tax bill in addition to your federal taxes, depending on where you live. From a federal tax perspective, the money in this account grows tax-free and can be used for college expenses beyond tuition, such as books, a computer and even room and board, with some restrictions. </p>
<p>You are even allowed to switch beneficiaries. This could come in handy if your original beneficiary decides to skip college. However, you’ll pay a 10% penalty tax and you’ll owe capital gains taxes if you use the money for non-higher education expenses. </p>
<p>Did you know you can also change the investment mix of a 529 plan by altering the beneficiary’s graduation date? This will change the growth rate of the plan’s assets depending on how aggressive or conservative you want your 529 plan to be. You’ll want to make sure that the mix is still appropriate for your circumstances. (You can use <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">our free tools</a> to track all your financial accounts, including a 529 plan.)</p>
<h2>Tax Credits and Student Loan Payment</h2>
<p>There are also a few other education expenses that can be leveraged in regards to taxes. For example, if you or your dependents are working toward a college degree, there’s a $2,500 tax credit you might be eligible for. Or you might check out the Lifetime Learning Credit if you’re honing some job-related skills. And if you are paying back your child’s student loans, there may be other viable tax deductions to consider. </p>
<h2>Retirement First!</h2>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>You should max out your retirement accounts first, even if your retirement picture looks bright, because generally the tax savings are better and the restrictions less onerous.</p>
</div>
<p>It’s important to prioritize your own retirement over paying for college – you can get a student loan for college, but no such loan exists for retirement. You should max out your retirement accounts first, even if your retirement picture looks bright, because generally the tax savings are better and the restrictions less onerous. For example, maxing out your 401k or IRA is more beneficial because the immediate tax deduction and the lengthy tax-deferred growth period are generally more advantageous than the tax-free growth associated with 529 plans. Likewise, if you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, max it out before establishing a 529 plan. Funds in a 529 plan can be pulled after the intended beneficiary turns 18, but there is a 10% penalty if the withdrawal does not fall under qualified education expenses. A Roth IRA offers more flexibility in how the funds are used.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life is meaningful and complex &#8211; and so are the taxes associated with it. If you&#8217;re considering what you would like to leave your family or pursuing charitable giving, there are certain tax implications of both to consider. </p>
<h2>The Estate Tax</h2>
<p>Many taxpayers have some understanding, even if it’s vague, that there are estate and gift-tax exemptions within the IRS code. But did you know that you can use something called an “annual exclusion” that allows Americans to transfer billions in assets tax free each year? </p>
<p>Overall, you will trigger estate taxes only after you have accumulated assets worth more than $5.49 million, for 2017. (The total amount adjusts each year for inflation.) That figure is based on an individual’s assets, so married couples can protect nearly $11 million from estate taxes. There’s an estate tax marital deduction, which exempts (at least until your spouse dies) all your estate, no matter how large, from federal estate taxes if your estate passes directly to your spouse. Effectively, this means few people need to worry about federal estate taxes. Some states, however, have estate tax provisions that kick in much earlier, so it pays to know the specific state laws where you live. In addition, the new administration will likely be making changes to the estate tax, so you will want to consult a professional.</p>
<h2>The Gift Tax</h2>
<p>The gift tax differs from estate tax in that it applies to assets transferred during your lifetime. However, some taxpayers can take advantage of the annual exclusion associated with the gift tax. </p>
<p>If your assets do exceed the amount sheltered from federal estate taxes, using the annual exclusion may be one way to help reduce the overall value of your assets. This exclusion allows you to give $14,000 (currently) per year to any one person—and you can give this gift to as many people as you want, no matter their relationship to you. If you have three children (and they all have spouses) and eight grandchildren, for example, you could reduce your assets by $196,000 in just one year. And your spouse can also use the exclusion, so you could pass out as much as $392,000 in just one year to these family members. You can give friends money, too, if you are inclined.</p>
<p>Not only do these annual gifts reduce your overall assets, but they do not count against the lifetime gift-tax exclusion for your potential heirs. This is where estate taxes and gift taxes become intertwined, at least at the federal level. From a gift-tax perspective, each person is walking around with an approximate $5.5 million lifetime exclusion. That means you can conceivably give up to ~$5.5 million as a non-taxable gift. However, the $5.5 million cannot be exceeded without paying gift taxes. </p>
<p>For example, if you are single, and give your daughter $4.5 million during your lifetime (above the annual $14k/year exclusion), your lifetime exclusion will be reduced by $4.5M, to ~$1M.  Then at the time of your death, if your estate is worth more than that ~$1M, you will be subject to estate taxes. You could use the annual exclusion to tack on an additional $14,000 each year, which does not count against her lifetime exclusion. And you make that gift every year for as long as you like—none of those gifts would erode her lifetime exclusion amount. </p>
<h2>Trusts</h2>
<p>There are many different types of trusts and each one is taxed differently, depending on its structure. From revocable/living trusts to irrevocable and testamentary trusts, trust taxation is highly personal to your own unique situation. Establishing a trust requires legal guidance, but you can start taking the right steps by <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">scheduling time with a registered financial advisor</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobody enjoys doctor visits, but with today’s high insurance deductibles and the enormous cost of other uncovered healthcare, the expenses may make you cringe more than the actual visit. </p>
<p>Did you know Uncle Sam has your back? </p>
<p>That’s right. There are a couple of tax advantages you can use to lower the overall cost of your medical care. These advantages can help you pay your portion of insurance premiums, copays and other uncovered medical bills and expenses—even transportation. However, they require planning and some specialized tax knowledge. </p>
<p>The two main options are Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Both let you allocate pre-tax dollars to pay for anticipated medical expenses: </p>
<h2>Flexible Spending Accounts</h2>
<p>When you establish an FSA, you set aside money from your salary before it is taxed, through a salary deferral. You save on taxes because you have lowered your taxable salary through this deferment. The deferred money in your FSA may be used to pay for qualified medical expenses, such as copays and deductibles. You can also use it for specified over-the-counter medication and transportation, if it meets the “qualified” criteria. </p>
<p>You establish a FSA during your employer’s open enrollment period when you determine the amount you want deferred and it will be deducted directly from your paycheck before taxes. There are a variety of ways to receive reimbursement for your actual medical expenses, depending on your specific plan. These are usually “use-it-or-lose-it” accounts, which means if you don’t use the funds in the year, you don’t get to roll over into the next year, so you should budget what you know you will be spending.</p>
<p>FSAs do have some restrictions, so check the specifics of your plan before you set your deduction.</p>
<h2>Health Savings Accounts</h2>
<p>HSAs are structured differently from FSAs, which may work better depending on your personal circumstances. You can think of a HSA more like a medical-specific trust. Funds allocated to HSAs can be invested and the subsequent growth is tax free, as well. More importantly, particularly for those who have unpredictable health costs, you cannot lose the unused funds in a HSA. Any remaining balance is carried forward, even into retirement. (After age 65, if you take the funds out, you will pay ordinary income tax on any funds not used for covered medical costs.) </p>
<p>You also own the account so the balance follows you if you change jobs or move to another state. Just like FSAs, you contribute to your HSA using pre-tax dollars, so the discounts you receive on your medical expenses work the same way—you save based on your tax bracket.</p>
<p>HSAs are usually for those who participate in a high deductible plan. Most employers will offer one, but make sure it makes sense for you and your family to select the high deductible plan to meet this requirement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time of the year again &#8211; tax time! It’s rarely anyone’s favorite time of the year. But what if this time, you approached taxes differently? What if you thought about taxes as a way to keep more of your money by actively managing them throughout the year? </p>
<p>Personal Capital’s 2017 Tax Series will give you ways to think about your taxes from a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/land/holistic_tax_report/" target="_blank">holistic financial point of view</a>, as well as how to in the framework of your investments. From maxing out your retirement accounts and saving for college to tax-loss harvesting and asset allocation, it’s time to take control of your taxes in 2017 and beyond.</p>
<h2>Retirement &#038; Taxes</h2>
<p>Despite the vital importance of retirement savings, many people tend to avoid the topic. For some, the date seems so distant. For others, the date is uncomfortably close, and they’re not sure if they’re on track. For both groups, retirement planning can feel complicated and, well, boring.</p>
<p>But it’s pretty tough to talk about retirement without considering taxes – when you save for retirement, you need to consider the tax treatment on those accounts.<br />
<img src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TAX-FAST-FACTS.jpg" alt="TAX-FAST-FACTS" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46308" srcset="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TAX-FAST-FACTS.jpg 2550w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TAX-FAST-FACTS-232x300.jpg 232w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TAX-FAST-FACTS-768x994.jpg 768w, https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TAX-FAST-FACTS-368x476.jpg 368w" sizes="(max-width: 2550px) 100vw, 2550px" /></p>
<h2>Your 401k</h2>
<p>Pretty much everyone has some basic knowledge about how a 401k works. Typically, this option is employer-sponsored, so the company provides an education about the available options, which can vary greatly. </p>
<p>The one-size-fits-all piece of advice for 401k participants is “employer-match” programs should be maxed out first—before considering any other retirement options. Why? Free money—who doesn’t like that. All 401k programs allow you to contribute pre-tax money, but employer-match programs require your employer to match the amount you contribute, up to certain limits. This means you avoid immediate taxes on the money you contribute and you get a matching bonus from your employer. Definitely a win-win.</p>
<h2>Your IRA</h2>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>The advantage of [Roth IRA] accounts is the tax-free distributions you’ll enjoy when you retire. This is particularly valuable if tax rates rise during the time your savings are growing.</p>
</div>
<p>Roth IRAs, traditional IRAs and Roth conversions are all options that offer you an opportunity to fine-tune your future retirement and to maximize your ultimate nest egg. </p>
<p>Simply put, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth for your assets, tax-free distributions, and no required minimum distributions during the original account holder’s lifetime. The catch? You must make contributions from funds that have already been taxed. The advantage of these accounts is the tax-free distributions you’ll enjoy when you retire. This is particularly valuable if tax rates rise during the time your savings are growing. You will have already paid 2017 tax rates on the contributed money, so you don’t need to worry about the prevailing tax rate in 2027, 2037 or 2047. There are income limits to contributing to Roth IRAs, so make sure you are familiar with the phase-out rules before opening and contributing one (if you already participate in your employer’s 401k plan, there will be phase outs on deducting your IRA contributions).</p>
<p>If you just can’t imagine parting with already taxed income, there is a traditional IRA option. Contributions to traditional IRAs are tax deductible, you won’t pay taxes now, but you will owe ordinary income taxes on your withdrawals.</p>
<h2>It’s All About Timing</h2>
<p>While these options sound simple enough, lots of decision making based on current and future personal circumstances is recommended. For example, there is the option to do a Roth conversion, which converts a traditional IRA or a portion of your 401k, if allowed by your employer’s plan, to a Roth IRA. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, then you may want to investigate this further &#8211; its tax- exempt nature amplifies compounding investment returns over time. </p>
<p>However, several criteria must be met before a Roth conversion makes sense, so make sure you do your homework on these before making any decision.</p>
<h2>Other Considerations</h2>
<p>Before you can make an educated decision about which options are best for your future, you may also need to understand the nuances of terms like Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) &#8211;  it’s a stock thing; and required minimum distribution (RMDs) &#8211; it’s an age thing. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Market Digest – Week Ending 2/24/2017</em><br />
The market rally paused for a breath, with global stocks roughly flat for the week. A strong jobs report Friday provided confidence and firmed expectations that the Fed will raise rates in March, but without having to accelerate tightening. Official unemployment edged down to 4.7%. Oil moved sharply lower on the week as U.S. shale producers continue to invest in new capacity. </p>
<p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
S&#038;P 500: 2,373 (-0.4%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US: (-0.1%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.57% (+0.09%)<br />
Gold: $1,205 (-2.4%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.067 (+0.5%)</p>
<p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monday &#8211; The Trump administration issued a revised travel ban, reducing to six the number of impacted countries and exempted lawful permanent residents.</li>
<li>Wednesday – The CIA scrambled to contain damage from a WikiLeaks release which described the agency’s cyber-spying capabilities.</li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; WTI oil prices dropped below $50 after an EIA report showed a spike in inventories.</li>
<li>Friday – Bitcoin prices dropped 18% after the SEC rejected a proposal by the Winklevoss twins to establish a publicly traded fund for the vehicle.</li>
<li>Friday – South Korean President Park Guen-hye, the country’s first female president, was ejected over accusations that she helped friends win bribes from conglomerates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our take:</strong><br />
Today, March 10, marks the 17th anniversary of the peak of the NASDAQ and the height of the dot-com bubble. Over the next few years, technology stocks would plummet 80%, decimating investor portfolios and reshaping the way many viewed investing. </p>
<p>There are some interesting parallels between 2017 and 1999. Technology stocks and the tech-heavy NASDAQ are again leading gains. The QQQs, made famous in the late-90s are outperforming the Vanguard Value Index by over 6% year to date. Stocks like Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Celgene and Google have been the drivers of this bull market. The Shiller PE ratio on the S&#038;P 500, which uses a 10 year average of earnings, surpassed 30 this week for the first time since the late 1990s. </p>
<p>All of this is no reason to panic. Stock prices are not nearly as out of touch with reality as they were in 1999. But it is worth revisiting the lessons learned from that period. Those whose investment portfolios were hurt irreparably were either loaded up excessively on technology stocks or sold near the bottom and didn’t get in until well after stocks had rebounded (often shortly before 2008 hit). Those who were even reasonably diversified and stayed invested would have felt uncomfortable at the time but probably now remember the 2000-2002 bear market as an afterthought. Unless they have made serious mistakes or were forced to make serious withdrawals, they should have a lot more money now.</p>
<p>All bull markets come to an end, you just never know when. It is hard to resist the lure of today’s tech darlings, but history provides a good reminder of why it makes sense to own them in proportion and not be the greedy one deep in a bull market.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the majority of high-income earners who have financial complexities such as business ownership, home ownership, investments and more, hiring an accountant can make sense. </p>
<p>However, some entrepreneurs and retirees prefer to face tax time alone, despite having significant investments or multiple streams of income.</p>
<p>What is it that makes someone hire a tax professional versus handling their own returns? Let’s look at the pros and cons.</p>
<h2>Pros: Time and Money</h2>
<p>Despite being a financial writer who enjoys handling money, I hire an accountant to do my taxes. I do this so that I can have a professional double check my business income and expenses. </p>
<p>I’m always concerned about properly listing my business deductions, and I want a second set of eyes to look over everything and make sure my deductions are accurate. I also want someone on my side should I get audited; someone I know well who has detailed knowledge of my personal and business transactions. I’m not alone. </p>
<p>John Schmoll, who owns the popular website <a href="http://www.frugalrules.com/" target="_blank">Frugal Rules</a> and co-owns a <a href="http://www.inkharmony.com/" target="_blank">copywriting business</a> with his wife, said, “As our business grew I felt that I was overlooking opportunities to save money in different areas, and that I really wasn&#8217;t doing our tax situation justice. We ended up hiring a CPA three-to-four years ago and, in all honesty, it&#8217;s one of the best things we&#8217;ve done for our business.” </p>
<p>John went on to say that his accountant saves them thousands of dollars each year by taking advantage of deductions that John wasn’t aware of previously.</p>
<p>This also brings up the great point that it can be good to work with someone to toss around ideas on how to lower your taxes. After a rather high tax bill this year, I’m already working with my accountant to plan for my 2017 taxes to find ways to reduce the taxes I may owe next year. Although I’m well versed when it comes to finances because of my job, I still enjoy working with a professional to see what he recommends to lower the amount I owe.</p>
<p>For Grayson Bell, the owner of the successful company <a href="https://www.imarkinteractive.com/" target="_blank">iMark Interactive</a>, hiring an accountant was more about saving his already limited time. He said, “I used to do my own taxes, but then realized I could better spend my time and energy running my business and gaining more clients.” </p>
<p>This makes sense too. It takes me hours just to gather and prepare all of the paperwork to send to my accountant. Plus, my accountant can complete my returns in way less time than it would take me. I’d rather focus on what I do best and outsource my taxes to someone who is an expert.</p>
<h2>Cons: A Missed Learning Opportunity</h2>
<p>You might assume that hiring an accountant is the way to go, especially for high income earners. That’s not always the best option, though. Although hiring an accountant does save time and has the potential to save money if you’re uncertain of deductions that apply to you, it still can be a pricey service. Plus, you miss out on personally learning about the tax code, which can prove useful in the future.</p>
<p>That’s a big reason why Greg Johnson decided to file his own taxes. Greg and his wife, Holly, run a successful blog called <a href="http://clubthrifty.com/" target="_blank">Club Thrifty</a>. Holly was recently featured in Forbes for earning $225,000 from freelance writing income alone, not including her and Greg’s blog business income. Add that to owning an LLC taxed as an S-corp and having two rental properties, and many would assume the Johnsons definitely need an accountant. </p>
<p>However Greg says, &#8220;Even though we earn more than we used to, I still choose to do my own taxes. In addition to saving money on accountant fees, doing my own taxes has taught me a lot about both my personal finances and my business.&#8221; </p>
<p>When you outsource this, you can give up the chance to learn about new tax laws and deductions that might affect your personal and business taxes. </p>
<p>My father-in-law, Darryl Alford, is another example of a high net worth individual who has filed his own taxes for over 50 years. Despite having rental property, complex investments, and multiple streams of income, he still manually completes the tax paperwork every year. When I asked him why he’s done his own taxes all these years (he’s 75) he said, “I just started doing it years and years ago when it was simple, and I just grew into it as it got more complex. Each year, I learned more and more, so it was just a gradual process.” </p>
<p>As you can see, deciding whether to hire an accountant is a very personal decision, and depending on how complex your finances are, you may want to put some thought into whether one is right for you. </p>
<p><em>Do you file your own taxes or do you hire an accountant? Why or why not?</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re considering buying rental property as an investment, you’re not alone. Demand for investment properties is strong and growing across the United States. According to the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/news-releases/2016/04/vacation-home-sales-retreat-investment-sales-leap-in-2015?random=76623482" target="_blank">National Association of Realtors</a>, investment home purchases in 2015 increased for the first time in five years – up 7%, translating to more than 1 million sales in 2015.  The typical investment-home buyer in 2015 had a median household income of $95,800 and bought a home that was 22 miles from their primary home.</p>
<p>But there’s another angle to these types of purchases: owner-occupied rental multi-units as investments. </p>
<p>While being a landlord and living in the same building as your tenant may sound like a setup for an NBC sitcom (or horror story, depending on your outlook), there are some key benefits to living in your own rental property. The main benefits come from being able to take advantage of <a href="https://www.fha.com/fha_article?id=371" target="_blank">Federal Housing Administration</a> (FHA) loans.</p>
<p>Remember, you should always consult with a financial or real estate professional before you invest in any property.</p>
<p>(For the purpose of this piece, we will focus on two-to-four unit properties, commonly known as “duplexes,” “triplexes,” or “fourplexes.”)</p>
<h2>Pay Your Mortgage with Rent Money</h2>
<p>Even though rents leveled off nationwide at the end of last year, the rental market has exploded over the previous years, with rents topping the <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/16/rents-now-top-list-of-fastest-rising-prices.html" target="_blank">list of fastest-rising prices</a> in June 2016. A recent report by <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/national-rent-data/" target="_blank">Apartment List</a> found there are significant shortages of low- and middle-income housing in the nation’s most expensive markets, and some of the fastest rent growth is happening in the smaller cities around the priciest areas.</p>
<p>With this trend occurring, there is a real possibility that some – or even all – of your mortgage for a two-to-four-unit dwelling could be paid by the rent you collect, giving you a virtually free place to live. </p>
<h2>Put Down a Smaller Down Payment with FHA Loans</h2>
<p>Loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA, may be the easiest route to buying duplexes or multi-family homes if you are planning use the property as your main residence <a href="http://homeguides.sfgate.com/can-rent-fha-loan-3231.html" target="_blank">for at least a year</a>. FHA loans require only a 3.5% down payment for owner-occupants of multi-family dwellings, compared to 20-to 30% down for investors buying a duplex or more units (if they are buying as an investment and not as a residence). You can also use gifted money for all of a down payment on FHA loans.</p>
<p>Note that putting only 3.5% down and leveraging an asset can be risky business. You should crunch the numbers carefully for your market so you can estimate how much you are likely to  receive in rents, and you have enough cash cushion to make this work through a downturn or a reduction of rental rates. </p>
<h2>Take Advantage of Residential vs. Commercial Loans</h2>
<p>The FHA has a few different loan programs for multi-unit properties. If you’re a new to investing in real estate, you may want to purchase a property with four or fewer units because FHA loans for such properties aren’t considered commercial property loans, which have more strict requirements and are often made through conventional loans. For instance, a loan for a residential property can be a fixed-rate loan with a consistent monthly payment, whereas most commercial loans are adjustable-rate mortgages with payments that can fluctuate.</p>
<p>There are a few things to consider, however. FHA borrowers for a property larger than a duplex — from three to four units — must have higher cash reserves to show they can handle the loan. Three months of mortgage payments are needed to qualify for a three- to four-unit property loan, which includes principal, interest, taxes and insurance. The cash reserves must be met whether the property is vacant or not; having a completely rented complex doesn’t necessarily mean that fewer reserves are needed. The reserves are to help show that you can meet the mortgage payments even if a unit is vacant for a while. One month’s reserves are needed for a one- to two-unit property.</p>
<p>One of the main criteria for a multi-unit FHA loan is that you (the owner) must live in one of the units. While this will make you a real estate investor in your own property, possibly allowing you to live mortgage-free, like any other home, rental property will have expenses. FHA loans require mortgage insurance, which protects the lender if you default on the loan. You’ll also have to pay for maintenance and property taxes.</p>
<h2>Use Rental Income to Qualify for a Loan</h2>
<p>One of the key benefits of buying a multifamily home and renting out the units while living in one of them is that some of the rental income can help you qualify for an FHA loan. Proof of rental income is needed for this to apply, but it can be projected rental income, based on a home appraisal and comparing to rental rates for similar homes in the area. The amount will be added to your income to help you qualify for a loan.</p>
<p>Only 75% of the rental income is added to an applicant’s income as a way to compensate for a 25% vacancy rate in rentals. Some lenders may require you to have experience as a landlord before approving a multifamily home loan — which is a Catch-22 if you’re trying to start as a landlord — while others may let you use projected rental income to qualify. Some lenders may require that renters have signed a lease to verify the rental payments.</p>
<p>FHA loans may differ by location. Some may have a vacancy rate lower than 25% that’s allowed, reducing the amount of rent that can be added to the borrower’s gross monthly income. </p>
<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<p>Owning rental property can be stressful. Be sure to study the area where you want to buy to see what the rental rate is, and if you’ll have enough cash flow and savings as a backup if rentals fall off for a few months. If it’s a risk worth taking, you could be on your way to becoming a real estate mogul.</p>

<p>Some key takeaways include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
We need to change the attitude of banks and brokers toward working in the best interest of the client, especially as they are descending upon Washington to try to repeal or delay the <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/might-die-younger-without-fiduciary-rule/" target="_blank">Fiduciary Rule</a></li>
<li>These same big banks and brokers are trying to <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/bill-harris-former-ceo-intuit-calls-baloney-j-p-morgan-intuit/" target="_blank">restrict customer access</a> to their own financial data to protect substandard products and high fees</li>
<li>The whole world over time is going to have to adapt to the fact that we are in a digital age</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, February 23, CloudFlare, a major Web service provider, disclosed a vulnerability in their infrastructure. This vulnerability has the potential to expose data from Web traffic that uses CloudFlare’s CDN (Content Delivery Network). CloudFlare handles a large share of Web traffic on the Internet, and has a reputation for security transparency. Personal Capital is a customer of CloudFlare and uses their CDN service to handle their Web traffic.</p>
<p>Personal Capital has received direct assurance from the CloudFlare security team that &#8220;your domain is not one of the domains where we have discovered exposed data in any third-party caches. The bug has been patched,” and “To date, we have yet to find any instance of the bug being exploited.”</p>
<p>We have done an independent analysis, and based on the nature of the issue, we are confident that none of our encryption keys have been compromised. While there is a wide area of potential exploits in a large-scale vulnerability like this, the actual probability of risk to any individual user in this case is extremely low. </p>
<h2>What Should I Do?</h2>
<p>This type of vulnerability is a good reminder to all of us to practice good security hygiene for our financial information on the internet. Our recommendations to all users are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use a financial data aggregation service such as Personal Capital for viewing your financial data, rather than logging in directly to your bank website. This reduces exposure of your banking passwords on the Internet.</li>
<li>Regularly monitor all of your financial accounts for unusual activity. Personal Capital’s financial dashboard, and our daily transaction monitoring email, are great ways to do this. We recommend that security-conscious users review their financial transactions twice per week.</li>
<li>Always exercise good password hygiene at financial institutions or other sensitive websites. This includes using long, random passwords rather than simple words, not using the same password at multiple sites, and changing passwords on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The likelihood of a problem is low, but caution is advised and our service makes it easy to monitor your accounts. </p>
<h2>Is My Information at Personal Capital Safe?</h2>
<p>Yes. And your Financial Institution (FI) passwords are heavily protected. The Personal Capital financial dashboard allows you to link your accounts from your financial institutions to give you a comprehensive view of your financial life. The credentials you provide us have many safeguards that are designed to protect your security and prevent compromise of these passwords.</p>
<p>The only time that your FI password ever passes between your browser and our website is when you first link your account (or when you update your FI password).  We never send an FI password back from our service  to your browser. So even in the event that your Personal Capital account were compromised (e.g. if you gave someone else your Personal Capital password), no attacker could ever obtain your FI passwords via your Personal Capital account.   </p>
<h2>Where can I can read more information?</h2>
<p>CloudFlare’s disclosure of their issue is available at: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/" target="_blank">https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Market Digest – Week Ending 2/24/2017</em><br />
U.S. equities continued to rise coming off the three day weekend, followed closely by their foreign counterparts. Stocks subsequently flat lined as investors digested the latest Fed minutes, but a late-Friday rally pushed US markets higher for the week. Treasuries, gold and real estate all ended the week in positive territory, while foreign stocks and commodities were down. </p>
<p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
S&#038;P 500: 2,367 (+0.7%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US: (-0.2%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.31% (-0.10%)<br />
Gold: $1,257 (+1.8%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.056 (-0.6%)</p>
<p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monday – President&#8217;s Day </li>
<li>Tuesday – Verizon announced it would still buy Yahoo’s core business, but lowered its offer by $350 million due to recent cyberattacks</li>
<li>Tuesday – The owners of Burger King and Tim Hortons announced it would acquire Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen for $1.8 billion in cash</li>
<li>Wednesday – Astronomers discovered seven earth-sized planets orbiting a dwarf star 40 light years away, which is relatively close in cosmic terms. The planets are in the unique position to harbor liquid water, and potentially life</li>
<li>Wednesday &#8211; The U.S. Federal Reserve released its latest minutes, indicating they could raise rates “fairly soon</li>
<li>Friday &#8211; U.S. new home sales increased 3.7% in January, which was less than expected</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our take:</strong><br />
The market didn’t react much following the latest Fed minutes, which presented a more aggressive tone regarding upcoming rate hikes. The language suggested a hike could come as early as March, with expectations unchanged for a three-quarter percentage point increase in 2017. And to no surprise, this has caused a common question to resurface: should bonds remain part of investors’ long-term portfolio allocations? </p>
<p>As we’ve said before, we believe they should. It is true bonds are inversely correlated to interest rates, so as rates rise, bond prices fall (and vice versa). This has driven many to believe bonds are toxic, and investors are better off staying in cash when faced with a potential rising rate environment, such as now. But the extent of this relationship is often misunderstood. </p>
<p>Let’s use a simplistic example with a hypothetical bond ETF. It has a moderate duration of 5 years and a yield of 2%. This means if interest rates rise by a full percentage point, one would expect the price of the bond ETF to fall by 5%, all other things constant. But the ETF still has its 2% yield, which would make up for a sizable portion of the price decline. So on a total return basis the ETF would only lose a few percentage points. Moreover, as the ETF purchases new bonds at prevailing interest rates (in order to maintain its target maturity range), the yield begins to increase. So it would only take another year to almost fully recover from the original price decline (again, keeping all other things constant). And from there the total return would become positive and the ETF’s yield would continue to rise until it reaches market rates.  </p>
<p>As such, we believe it is highly likely a diversified mix of bonds with a moderate duration will outperform cash over a multiyear period—even in the face of rising rates. One has to remember that by holding cash you are actually losing money to inflation every year. Moreover, bonds continue to offer valuable downside protection and diversification benefits relative to stocks. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One thing we’ve learned as world events have taken us by storm this past year: expect the unexpected. Last summer, a little event called Brexit caught the world by surprise. Markets fluttered again throughout the 2016 presidential election. And just a few months ago, millions of Americans were shocked when the polls came in to show who would be the 45th president of the United States. </p>
<p>What does a new political and market climate mean for your finances this year? Apply these five strategies to your financial plan to weather any new storms on the horizon:</p>
<h2>1. Diversify your portfolio to protect against market volatility</h2>
<p>We are currently in the ninth year of a bull market, meaning the market has been up since 2009. With a new administration in the White House and the knowledge that volatility can happen at any time, all eyes are on any potential cause for a market swing. While it’s impossible to predict what the new presidency will mean for your portfolio, it’s critical to protect your investments against market uncertainty.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that we are due for a market correction or a bear market at some point, regardless of the cause. We can’t predict when this might happen &#8211; the longest bull market ran 4,494 days from 1987 to 2000 &#8211; but it’s important that you prepare for both the best-and worst-case scenarios.  </p>
<p>Bottom line? Stay diversified. Don’t get caught up in what everyone else is doing with their investments. Don’t throw all of your money toward the hottest tech stocks. And don’t try to time the market. Protect your portfolio against market bubbles and volatility with a portfolio that is invested across sectors and in both U.S. and international stocks, and isn’t heavily weighted in any given company. </p>

<h2>2. Don’t hold too much cash</h2>
<p>A common mistake that many investors make when they worry about market uncertainty is holding too much cash. It might feel safer to hold onto your cash now than to watch your investments fluctuate, but inflation will eat away at your cash when you could be earning a larger return over time. And facts are facts &#8212; in the past 10 years, cash has never been the best performing asset class across a year. Even in 2008 when the market crashed, there were better places to invest. Both gold and treasuries outperformed cash during 2008’s collapse. For an idea of how much cash underperformed other asset classes in 2016, check out the chart below:  </p>
<p><strong>Full-Year Asset Class Return &#8211; 2016</strong><br />

<h2>3. Know how to plan for rising interest rates</h2>
<p>Although there are many unknowns, one thing we do know is that under the new administration, the Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates. The Fed’s responsibility is to provide consumers with a safe, flexible and stable financial system. When times are good, the Fed typically keeps rates higher to prevent inflation (i.e. the rate at which the general level of prices is rising resulting in the general value of currency falling). When times are tough, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage economic activity. The Fed announced a 0.25% interest rate hike in December, which was only the second raise since 2006. The Fed indicated that more hikes would be on the horizon in 2017. With rates likely to go up, it’s important to have an understanding of what this could mean for you.</p>
<h2>Credit cards</h2>
<p>If you have credit card debt, higher rates are bad news because your bank will likely charge higher interest rates on debt (and be slower to pass on higher yields on your checking and savings accounts). Most credit cards have a variable rate that is based on the prime rate. This prime rate has a very strong correlation to the Fed rate, so oftentimes an increase in the Fed rate means an increase in the prime rate. The Fed’s 0.25% rate hike can mean you’ll pay an extra $25 a year for every $1,000 of debt. That may not seem like a lot, but it can quickly add up over the years if you carry a balance. While credit card rates are already high enough that new hikes may not feel too noticeable, now&#8217;s a better time than ever to pay down your credit card balance to avoid the extra expense altogether.</p>
<h2>Mortgages</h2>
<p>The combination of the Fed’s hike announcements and expectations around the new administration&#8217;s policy means that longer-term interest rates have risen, bringing mortgage rates with them. A typical 30-year fixed mortgage now carries a 4.5% interest rate, which is about 1% higher than six months ago. To put this into context, a previous $1,800 monthly payment on a $400,000 home loan is now up to an approximate $2,000 monthly payment. Over the life of that 30-year mortgage, that’s an extra nearly $83,000 you will owe.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that long-term mortgages are based in part on future Fed rate moves in the near term, and the Fed has announced that three more hikes are in store for 2017. </p>
<h2>4. Understand the Fiduciary Rule and what a potential repeal/delay means for you</h2>
<p>Last April, The Department of Labor announced that a new Fiduciary Rule would be rolled out on April 10 of this year. The rule requires all financial advisors and brokers to act in “the best interest” of their clients when it comes to retirement accounts, including 401k’s, individual retirement accounts, IRA rollovers and other retirement-qualified funds (the rule doesn’t affect non-retirement accounts). Experts believe that the rule will affect more than $3 trillion in retirement assets in the United States.</p>
<p>This new rule has faced fierce opposition from brokers and from the heavily funded financial services lobby, as advisors who are not fiduciaries simply have to meet a “suitability standard.” This means an advisor could conceivably steer a client into a product that pays the advisor a higher commission, as long as that product is “suitable” for the client. The new administration has indicated that it may delay or repeal the Fiduciary Rule. If this happens, then it’s important that you take the initiative to ensure you are working with a financial advisor who puts your best interests before their own bottom line. </p>
<p>To make sure your advisor is giving you advice that is in your best interest, ask how they are compensated, if they have a sales quota to fill, why they are recommending a particular investment and whether they are a fiduciary. If they aren’t a fiduciary &#8211; find another financial advisor.</p>
<h2>5. Optimize your taxes</h2>
<p>Tax season is right around the corner. And if you’re like most Americans, you’ll do whatever it takes to decrease your tax bill this year. Here are a few of the commonly overlooked ways to save big at tax time.</p>
<p>Some often-overlooked deductions and credits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>State sales tax &#8211; You can choose to deduct either state income tax you paid or the state sales tax you paid. The IRS even has a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/sales-tax-deduction-calculator" target="_blank">handy calculator</a> that will help you calculate state sales tax.<br />
Foreign tax credits &#8211; You can also deduct or take a credit for foreign taxes on foreign income. Many mutual funds have stocks from foreign and multi-national companies, which could be paying your foreign dividends or capital gains.</li>
<li>Tuition and education expenses &#8211; You can earn an annual tax credit of up to $2,500 per eligible student for the first four years of higher education through the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/aotc" target="_blank">American Opportunity Tax Credit</a>. Or you may qualify for a credit of up to $2,000 per tax return through the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/llc" target="_blank">Lifetime Learning Credit</a> if you are taking a class or two to improve job skills.</li>
<li>Child care credit &#8211; You may qualify for a tax credit of 20-35% of what you pay for childcare expenses while you (and your spouse, if filing jointly) work. The maximum amount of childcare expenses you’re allowed to claim is up to $6,000 for two or more children.</li>
<li>Baggage fees &#8211; If you are traveling for business and your airline ticket is deducted as part of your travel expenses, make sure you deduct any baggage fees you’re charged. They can be deducted just like any of your other travel expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re entering a new political era, but even with uncertainty around what the markets, the president or your portfolio will do this year, you have the power to take control of your financial plan. With a strategic approach, you can protect your finances regardless of what the future holds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know how vital it is to have easy access to your financial data in order to run your financial life. So important, that Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires banks and brokers to provide their customers with electronic access to their own financial data.  </p>
<p>J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and other big banks and brokers have proposed a plan that would have the effect of restricting their customers’ data access. In his annual letter to shareholders, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon emphasized how concerned he is about protecting the security of his customers:</p>
<ul>
“One item that I think warrants special attention is when our customers want to allow outside parties to have access to their bank accounts and their bank account information. Our customers have done this with payment companies, aggregators, financial planners and others. We want to be helpful, but we have a responsibility to each of our customers, and we are extremely concerned&#8230; We are now actively working with all third parties who are willing to work with us to set up data sharing the right way.”</ul>
<p>Contrary to Mr. Dimon’s intention, this “right way” would actually <em>decrease</em> customer access to their data and <em>weaken</em> the cybersecurity protecting the money in customer accounts at his bank. The existing ecosystem of data aggregation operates at huge scale with high security connecting 14,000 financial institutions with tens of millions of consumers. It isn’t broken. Let’s be careful not to break it.</p>
<p>The banks propose to use a cybersecurity protocol called OAuth, a recognized framework that would be a good choice to solve a different problem. OAuth requires a central “Identity Provider.” Some banks want to be that Identity Provider, in order to shift control of the data from the consumer to the bank, and to decide who gets what information when. In his shareholder letter, Mr. Dimon stated why he wants to determine who gets access to which data: “Far more information is taken than [his customer and the software she uses] needs in order to do its job.” Personal Capital believes each customer should have the right to determine which data they want. </p>
<p>“Malware and phishing are constant security hazards for consumers. The most vulnerable moment for a hacker to steal your password is when you type it into your own browser,” said our Chief Technology Officer, Fritz Robbins. “Minimizing the number of times that bank passwords are entered on your browser helps keep online banking safe. When you use a data aggregation service like Personal Capital, you enter your bank password once and only once. Never again do you need to enter your bank password to see your bank data.”</p>
<p>The current ecosystem of data aggregation uses a combination of four methods to securely collect the data:  Secure Channel, OFX, Server-Side Scraping and Client-Side Scraping. “Using any of these methods, you enter your bank password only once,” said Robbins. “Using OAuth, you’d have to enter your bank password any time the bank chose to expire your OAuth token – potentially daily. And you’d typically have to type it into a pop-up browser window similar to that used in phishing attacks.”  </p>
<p>Widespread use of OAuth would weaken the cybersecurity protecting consumer bank accounts. OAuth is less secure than the current methods of data aggregation. Surprising as it may be, the least secure way to look at your bank data is to log into your bank website.</p>
<p>The following diagram is from Personal Capital’s response to the Consumer Financial Protection Board (CFPB) Request for Information Regarding Consumer Access to Financial Records. See the full report at <a href="http://personalcapital.com/rights" target="_blank">personalcapital.com/rights</a> – it’s a bit of a snoozer, but not bad if you’re trying to nod off.</p>

<p>Not only is data aggregation a more secure way to look at your bank data, it’s also the best available means to protect your accounts against fraud of all types. We recommend everyone monitor their accounts twice a week. With an aggregation service, you can see all transactions in all accounts at all banks and brokers in 30 seconds.</p>
<p>I’m a bit of an expert on cybersecurity. I founded three different cybersecurity companies – one of which built the online authentication system used by the majority of the bank websites in the U.S. – and served on the board of directors of RSA Security, the largest cybersecurity company in the world. </p>
<p>And I’ve previously <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/bill-harris-former-ceo-intuit-calls-baloney-j-p-morgan-intuit/" target="_blank">commented</a> on the banks’ campaign to require OAuth before granting customer access to their own data. Over one thousand Personal Capital customers have expressed their opinions <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/consumers-scream-fiduciary-rule-section-1033-dodd-frank/" target="_blank">by email, post or video</a>, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Market Digest – Week Ending 2/17/2017</em><br />
U.S. stocks rose to record highs even as the political situation in Washington remained somewhat chaotic. National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned Monday after reports that he discussed sanctions against Russia with Russia&#8217;s ambassador and misled Vice President Mike Pence. His expected replacement, Robert Harward, declined the offer. In M&#038;A news, two mega-deals in the health insurance industry were terminated, as had been expected for some time. On Friday, Kraft-Heinz offered to buy Unilever for $143 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
S&#038;P 500: 2,351 (+1.5%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.7%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.41% (+0.01%)<br />
Gold: $1,235 (+0.1%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.062 (-0.2%)</p>
<p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monday – Allergan agreed to pay $2.5 billion for Zeltiq Aesthetics, makers of the CoolSculpting System which uses cooling to kill fat cells</li>
<li>Tuesday – Health insurers Aetna and Humana agreed not to fight an antitrust decision to block their $34 billion merger</li>
<li>Wednesday – Health insurer Cigna announced it was calling off its $48 billion deal with Anthem and is seeking $13 billion in damages in addition to a breakup fee</li>
<li>Thursday – U.S. retail sales were up 5.6% compared with a year ago, more than expected. Meanwhile, consumer inflation rose 2.5%, the most since 2012</li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; Annual inflation across 35 developed economies rose 1.8%, the most in about two years and close to the target for many countries of around 2%</li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; Ford announced it would invest almost $1 billion in a startup aimed at creating self-driving cars</li>
<li> Thursday &#8211; Snap Inc. lowered the expected range for its much anticipated IPO, now valuing the company in $19-$22 billion range</li>
<li>Friday &#8211; Kraft-Heinz made a $143 billion offer for Unilever, which was initially rejected</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our take:</strong><br />
The bull marches on. Wednesday marked the fifth consecutive day of record highs for the S&#038;P 500, Dow and NASDAQ. It is the first time that has happened in 25 years. Tech stocks are leading the way and it is not hard to draw similarities between now and 1999. </p>
<p>One big difference from our perspective, however, is a lack of greed on the part of investors. In 1999, retail investors couldn’t get enough of tech stocks and they felt entitled to 20+% gains every year. Today, tech darlings still rank among investor favorites, but other sectors are not entirely ignored. Meanwhile, most investors seemed pleasantly surprised with high single-digit gains last year and the strong start this year. </p>
<p>We don’t see much fear, greed or even complacency. It is more like confusion. Dramatic losses in 2008 shook out much of the overconfidence in many investors. More recently, the surprise Brexit and the U.S. election drove home the fact that the world is unpredictable. So it seems the consensus approach is to wait and see. In our view, that is neither bullish nor bearish. At the individual level, as long as investors are purposeful in maintaining an appropriate diversified asset allocation, it is probably just fine.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you and your spouse prepared to walk down the aisle, chances are you were daydreaming about that beautiful day to profess your love to the world, that search for your first home together, and even starting a family. The honeymoon often ends, though, <a href="http://debtfreeguys.com/2016/12/gay-finances/" target="_blank">when it comes to money</a> – what are you going to do with your taxes? </p>
<p>For most married couples, <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-brackets/" target="_blank">the difference between filing separately or jointly is considerable and the decision is consequential</a>. As we’re coming up on Valentine’s Day and in the heart of the 2017 tax season, let’s discuss this season’s most pertinent question: How will you and your spouse file your taxes?</p>
<p>Let’s look at some examples, and for illustrative purposes, we’ll assume that no deductions are taken.</p>
<h2>Married and Filing Jointly vs. Married and Filing Separately</h2>
<p><strong>Different Incomes</strong><br />
Kristy is a teacher who makes $35,000 per year. Her husband Steven owns a business, and he makes $200,000 per year. Kristy is in the 15% tax bracket, so she owes $4,786 in taxes. Steven is in the 33% tax bracket and owes $53,707 in taxes. If they file their taxes as married individuals filing separately, the total combined they owe in taxes is $58,493.</p>
<p>However, if they file as married individuals filing jointly, they are in the 33% tax bracket and will end up owing $52,963. They earn a “bonus” of $5,530 by filing jointly.</p>
<p><strong>Similar Incomes</strong><br />
Jeremy is an engineer and makes $120,000 per year. His husband Terrell is in sales and makes $130,000 per year. They are both in the 33% tax bracket, so Jeremy owes $27,307 and Terrell owes $30,607 in taxes. Together, they owe $57,913 if they were to file separately. However, if they filed jointly, then they would owe $57,913 as well. </p>
<h2>Tax Credits and Tax Deductions</h2>
<p>Other variables to consider in this equation are tax credits and tax deductions. Tax credits are dollar-for-dollar reductions on tax bills. Tax deductions are a reduction in taxable income contingent on tax brackets. Credits and deductions lower net tax bills.</p>
<p>Some of these include, but aren’t limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/child-and-dependent-care-credit" target="_blank">Child and Dependent Care</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/eitc-income-limits-maximum-credit-amounts-next-year" target="_blank">Earned Income Tax Credits</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/education-credits-questions-and-answers" target="_blank">Education Credits</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/aotc" target="_blank">American Opportunity</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch03.html" target="_blank">Lifetime Learning Education Credits</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that filing jointly affords tax credits that may not apply if married couples file separately. In addition, joint filers must meet higher income thresholds for some tax credits and deductions. While they can earn more in combined household income before paying higher rates, they must earn more to qualify for certain tax credit and deductions.</p>
<h2>Potential Tax Risks</h2>
<p>Filing jointly poses its own risks if one spouse has tax issues, such as owing the IRS money. If a spouse has a tax lien or is in debt to Uncle Sam, their new spouse may assume the responsibility of these burdens if they file jointly. If such couples file separately, the tax liens and government debt remain the sole responsibility of the original spouse.  As such, filing separately could shield certain assets from the government.</p>
<p>Filing separately reduces deductions such as those mentioned previously, in addition to deductions such as those for traditional Individual Retirement Account. While it’s good to invest in an IRA regardless, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/2016-ira-contribution-and-deduction-limits-effect-of-modified-agi-on-deductible-contributions-if-you-are-not-covered-by-a-retirement-plan-at-work">filing separately reduces immediate benefits</a>. One of you may qualify to contribute the maximum to a Roth IRA if you file separately, whereas filing jointly neither of you may qualify. </p>
<p>Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is the total of all income minus specific deductions. Deductions that require a percentage of AGI are easier to meet by filing separately rather than jointly. Such deductions include but aren’t limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Alimony deduction</li>
<li>Miscellaneous expenses greater than 2% of your AGI</li>
<li>Emergencies greater than 10% of your AGI</li>
</ul>
<p>This may all sound terribly confusing. No matter how much you learn about taxes here and elsewhere, it’s best to work with a tax professional. The IRS and certain companies offer ways to file taxes for free, but it’s worth your time to speak with a tax professional to get all your tax questions answered.</p>
<p>Whether you and your spouse choose to file your taxes jointly or separately, filing properly may help you more quickly achieve that happily-ever-after you daydreamed about together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Market Digest – Week Ending 2/10/2017</em></p>
<p>Global stocks started the week flat to slightly down, then rallied on Thursday and into Friday after the new administration promised major tax reforms are on the way. Defensive assets such as gold and bonds went the opposite route, rising through Wednesday then pulling back Thursday, but both were able to end the week positive. The dollar strengthened against the euro. </p>
<p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
S&#038;P 500: 2,316 (+0.8%)<br />
FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.3%)<br />
US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.40% (-0.06%)<br />
Gold: $1,234 (+1.1%)<br />
USD/EUR: $1.064 (-1.3%)</p>
<p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monday – ECB President Maria Draghi commented that it was too early to stop its stimulus program, despite higher inflation figures from Germany</li>
<li>Tuesday – BP reported a 2016 net loss for the second consecutive year, following a string of disappointing earnings from other energy firms amidst lower oil prices</li>
<li>Wednesday – A federal judge ruled against health insurer Anthem’s proposed $54 billion takeover of Cigna, stating the market is already too highly concentrated</li>
<li>Thursday – The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco declined to reinstate the President’s travel ban, stating it likely violated due process rights for travelers</li>
<li>After weeks, the U.S. president finally committed to China’s “One China” policy, in which the US won’t recognize Taiwan diplomatically</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our take:</strong><br />
Personal Capital&#8217;s CEO, Bill Harris, thoroughly covered how the <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/fiduciary-rule-lives-texas-die-washington-dc/" target="_blank">outlook for the Department of Labor’s much-needed Fiduciary Rule got a lot bleaker</a>. Following the president’s order for a review, yesterday the DOL has officially requested a delay of the rule’s implementation for 180 days while it seeks another round of public comments for consideration. Very tough to say where this leads, but it could result in a much more diluted version of the rule, or even its full repeal.  </p>
<p>What would that mean for the state of the industry? It would certainly be a loss for investors, who have long been subject to extreme conflict of interests where brokers (who now call themselves &#8220;financial advisors&#8221;) are able to set their client’s best interests aside in order to pitch high commission-based products. These are often in the form of front-loaded mutual funds, annuities and expensive insurance products disguised as investment vehicles.  </p>
<p>So a full repeal, or even dilution, of the Fiduciary Rule would be unfortunate as there were already some positive industry changes underway. A number of firms said they would stop offering commission-based retirement accounts, and would more clearly break out fees and broker compensation on statements. Many mutual fund companies even started offering “clean shares,” which are free of commissions advisors would normally receive from selling them. Are these perfect solutions that would eliminate all conflicts of interest? No. But they’re at least a step in the right direction. The big question is whether they’re maintained should the rule be shot down. </p>
<p>We know there is tidal wave of change in the financial services industry. More than ever, investors are demanding greater transparency on fees and commissions. But these aren’t the people the Fiduciary Rule was designed to protect. It was created for the unheard voices &#8211; those unaware of the rampant fees they’re paying, or severe conflicts of interest with their advisor. For them, the death of the Fiduciary Rule would surely be a sad day, even though they may not know it.   </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of the most famous lines from one of history’s most well-known love stories involves a young woman asking her love interest to cut off his family. If he refuses to do so, she’s prepared to disown her own family and identity, based only on his pledging his love to her. </p>
<p>But what if the conversation had been more like this? </p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?<br />
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;<br />
Or if thou wilt not, be, but <strong><em>financially independent, with regular contributions to a tax-advantaged savings account and hold only low-interest credit card debt</em></strong>,<br />
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>If they lived, would Romeo and Juliet have discussed finances? Money is not on the list of romantic topics. <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/04/money-is-the-leading-cause-of-stress-in-relationships.html" target="_blank">But it is the leading cause of stress in a relationship</a>. So if you’re interested in lasting longer than the star cross’d pair, there are some basic money talks we recommend having with your partner as you move through different life stages together. These can be uncomfortable conversations, but being open and honest about money is a key to a happy successful partnership.</p>
<h2>Determining financial compatibility</h2>
<p>There’s no denying you’re compatible &#8211; you both love indie films, rock climbing, quotes from “The Office,” and dancing in the rain. But are you compatible financially? There are some basics you should learn about your partner before you start thinking seriously about a future together. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt numbers</strong> – Does your partner have any debt, and if so, how much and what are their rates? For instance, having $50,000 in high interest credit card debt is a lot worse than having a $50,000 mortgage.</li>
<li><strong>Income picture and job stability</strong> – While you know the struggling artist or the beautiful actress-turned-waitress are true <em>artistes</em> at heart, are they bringing in viable income now, and in the foreseeable future? Can you count on them to contribute to a long-term financial future, or will you be shouldering the main load?</li>
</li>
<li><strong>Savings patterns</strong> – What does long-term savings look like for your partner? Do they look to the future and pattern their savings habits to meet that future?</li>
<li><strong>Spending patterns</strong> – Saving can only be accomplished in context of spending; after all, spending drastically impacts what you can save. Your partner might make six figures, but if he or she is spending 99% of that income, then there’s no way to viably save. Our free online tools, like our <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">Personal Capital dashboard</a>, helps you think through your finances, allowing you to link all your financial accounts so you can see a complete picture of your spending and savings habits.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term financial goals</strong> – At the end of the day, these conversations should support a long-term financial goal. Does your partner’s idea of a long-term financial goal mean blowing off retirement savings in favor of affording the new Tesla? Or does it mean he or she is planning their personal finances to support a solid retirement lifestyle? You can use our <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/retirement-planner" target="_blank">Retirement Planner</a> to see if you and your partner are in sync and on track with your long-term financial goals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Moving in together</h2>
<p>Before you move in together, it’s a good idea to talk about who pays for what, so you’re not figuring this when you’re committed to living with this person for at least a year or more. Will you be splitting rent equally? What if there&#8217;s a mortgage and you have property taxes? How about divvying up utilities or groceries? Do you have a car? What about a pet? These factors that play into your daily life cost money – and it’s smart to think through whose dollars support which part, especially if you have variable incomes.</p>
<h2>Getting Married</h2>
<p>Getting married means you’re now legally bound to a person in a way that’s different than any other partnership. But before you tie that knot, there are things you need to consider. The first concerns the wedding itself. The <a href="http://www.costofwedding.com/" target="_blank">average wedding cost</a> in the United States is $26,645. Tack on an extra $5,000 for the <a href="http://experience.usatoday.com/beach/story/caribbean/2014/06/04/caribbean-value-honeymoon/9970857/" target="_blank">average cost of a honeymoon</a>, and you have some serious things to consider even before you walk down the aisle. At these prices, what kind of wedding do you want, how much are you willing to pay, and who will pay for it? </p>
<p>The money conversations doesn&#8217;t end just when you say “I do.” As you think about combining two lives – and that includes financial lives – you should also be thinking about combining assets. Do you want to keep them separate or will you blend them? And while no one likes to think about, you do need to consider about what happens if “‘til death do us part” becomes “‘til divorce do us part.” For example, if you live in a community property state, getting married basically combines everything – do you need a prenuptial agreement, especially if one of you has a higher net worth? </p>
<h2>Having Children</h2>
<p>Having children is pricey. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/" target="_blank">According to CNN Money</a>, the cost of raising a child from birth to age 17 these days is nearly a quarter of a million dollars, which grows to $372,200 if you’re part of a high-income household. With such a hefty price tag, you and your partner should be talking about how many kids you can afford. </p>
<p>Education is a big discussion as well. Do you want your children to be privately or publicly educated? The <a href="http://www.privateschoolreview.com/tuition-stats/private-school-cost-by-state" target="_blank">national private elementary school average</a> is nearly $9,000 per year, and the private high school average is close to $13,500 per year. And education doesn’t just stop at grade school level. College is another hefty number to consider – remember how we said that it can cost up to a quarter of a million to raise a child? That’s before college costs. Today, the <a href="http://www.collegedata.com/cs/content/content_payarticle_tmpl.jhtml?articleId=10064" target="_blank">average cost of tuition and fees</a> for a private college is $33,480 per year. For a public college, the number comes down to $9,650. How much toward college are you wanting to contribute, and are you able and ready to start saving toward that? </p>
<p>And there’s a more high-level point of view to take when it comes to your kids: What types of money attitudes and outlooks are you planning to pass on to your children? How will you teach them about money?</p>
<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<p>It’s anyone’s guess whether Romeo and Juliet would have ended up together had fate not intervened the way Shakespeare wrote it; after all, they only had their families to feud about. But in the real world, money and love should go hand in hand if you want your relationship to, unlike theirs, survive past the fifth act.</p>

<p>Justice was done in Texas. As one of the only financial firms advocating for working families and retirees by supporting the Fiduciary Rule, Personal Capital applauds this courageous ruling. I was not there in Texas to witness the rule’s heroic survival, but I am here in Washington witnessing it’s quick and efficient execution. And with it’s presumed death, so goes the retirement prospects of families across the nation. The only thing that gives me hope is paraphrasing <a href="http://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2010/06/reports-of-my-death-are-greatly.html" target="_blank">Mark Twain’s famous quip</a>: &#8220;Rumors of the Fiduciary Rule&#8217;s death are greatly exaggerated.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Fiduciary Rule requires firms providing retirement accounts to do so in the best interest of the customers, not of the firms themselves. The Department of Labor, which has jurisdiction over the retirement accounts of American workers, developed this “no conflict of interest” rule over six years with input from consumers and financial firms. It is scheduled to go into effect this April.</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote right"><p>&#8220;At worst, the only speech the rules even arguably regulate is misleading advice.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Chief U.S. District Judge Lynn upheld the rule, shooting down each of seven challenges. One of the challenges argued the rule limits free speech, to which she replied in her 81-page ruling: &#8220;At worst, the only speech the rules even arguably regulate is misleading advice.&#8221; </p>
<p>Nevertheless, because of changing objectives in Washington, the Labor Department quickly reversed course and attacked it’s own rule – first requesting a stay of the Texas ruling and then announcing it would delay the rule’s implementation. The Labor Department – once a mighty gunfighter for the nation’s 125 million workers – turned tail and ran in the face of Wall Street’s artillery.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve spoken out before in support of the <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/might-die-younger-without-fiduciary-rule/" target="_blank">Fiduciary Rule</a> and the benefits of <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/bill-harris-former-ceo-intuit-calls-baloney-j-p-morgan-intuit/" target="_blank">Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act</a>. So have the customers of Personal Capital, <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/consumers-scream-fiduciary-rule-section-1033-dodd-frank/" target="_blank">over 1,000 of whom have expressed strong opinions</a> on the necessity of a rule protecting their financial future.</p>
<p><strong>Fiduciary Rule Could Save 30% of Retiree’s Nest Egg</strong><br />
Without the Fiduciary Rule, conflicts of interest will cost investors their hard-earned savings in commissions and high, often hidden, fees. Specifically, Wednesday’s ruling quotes the Federal Register Fiduciary Rule definition:<br />
<em><br />
“Today’s marketplace [commissions give]&#8230;advisers a strong reason, conscious or unconscious, to favor investments that provide them greater compensation rather than those that may be most appropriate for the participants&#8230;an ERISA plan investor who rolls her retirement savings into an IRA could lose 6% to 12% and possibly as much as 23% of the value of her savings over 30 years of retirement by accepting advice from a conflicted financial adviser.”</em></p>
<p>Based on a study of <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/fee-analyzer" target="_blank">Personal Capital users’ own data and the fees</a> they are currently paying, unnecessary fees and conflicted advice leads to over 30% fewer assets for their retirement. For the average Personal Capital user, this means hundreds of thousands less in retirement savings and a substantial reduction in retirement readiness.</p>
<p><strong>Fiduciary Rule Protects Workers and Retirees</strong><br />
The Fiduciary Rule is also necessary to protecting investors who must make complex decisions about their own investments where the onus of securing a well-funded retirement is largely placed on the individual. Wednesday’s ruling quotes the DOL in saying:</p>
<p><em>“[A]t the same time as individual investors have increasingly become responsible for managing their own investments, the complexity of investment products and range of conflicted compensation structures have likewise increased. As a result, it is appropriate to revisit and revise the exemption to better reflect the realities of the current marketplace.”</em><br />
<strong><br />
Broker Incentives Must Be Changed</strong><br />
The bottom line is that without an appropriate fiduciary responsibility, most financial institutions have no reason to stop exploiting their  customers inability to cope with the increasing complexity of investment products. The DOL has specifically reviewed studies conducted around mutual funds to assess the conflicts to consumers without a Fiduciary Rule: </p>
<p><em>“Broker-sold mutual funds provide an incentive to brokers to sell their products, but the record reflects that conflicted brokers “reinforce erroneous beliefs about the market” and “guide people towards high-fee funds.”</em></p>
<p>Personal Capital has always been a fiduciary of its customers’ money. I urge every financial institution with responsibility for a consumer’s life savings to stick up for the customer’s best interest, not for their own bottom line.</p>
<p>On with the good fight for the Fiduciary Rule!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend, Personal Capital conducted a survey of some of its users regarding the potential repeal of the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule and Section 1033 of Dodd-Frank. The Fiduciary Rule eliminates conflicts of interest in retirement accounts and Section 1033 requires that banks and brokers give their customers access to their own financial data.</p>
<p>The number of people responding filled our inboxes to the brim!  And the vast majority were against repeal.  Many included their own passionate statements and even selfie videos.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-01-2017/aarp-responds-executive-action-retirement-savings.html" target="_blank">American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)</a>, which represents 38 million members, made a statement: “It is time that all Americans can count on retirement investment advice that is in their best interest, not the interest of Wall Street.”</p>
<p>I made my own statements about <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/bill-harris-former-ceo-intuit-calls-baloney-j-p-morgan-intuit/" target="_blank">Section 1033 of Dodd Frank here</a> and about the <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/might-die-younger-without-fiduciary-rule/" target="_blank">Fiduciary Rule here</a>. Here are excerpts from a small sample of over 1,000 comments.  A few of the videos have been uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nks4spbKO_4" target="_blank">YouTube here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
“I absolutely believe the current status and timed future additions under the current law <em>MUST</em> be retained. I strongly reject any government attempt to withdraw, challenge, or alter current policies and timelines in place.”</li>
<li>“Unfortunately, this will have a large effect on many people who are most likely unaware. It&#8217;s sad to prey on average individuals just attempting to save for retirement. Disgusting really.”</li>
<li>“I hope and pray our elected officials will do the right thing for the people &#8212; Do not repeal Dodd-Frank and implement the Fiduciary Rule <em>FULLY</em>. If the banks get their way on this we are surely screwed. Banks need accountability <em>TO US</em>. Consumers deserve fairness and transparency <em>FROM THE BANKS</em>.”</li>
<li>“This is crazy!”</li>
<li>“This ‘data prison’ move by the banks and other financial institutions is so clearly true&#8230;. I’ve personally lived through the troubles of intermittent access issues in Mint and PC and Quicken and other financial tools. I entirely share the belief that we would all lose critical visibility to our collective finances without the tools provided by the aggregators and other FinTech companies.”</li>
<li>“Let Congress know that the people need protection from unethical bankers and financial groups.”</li>
<li>“Please keep my data free.”</li>
<li>“It&#8217;s absurd to <em>REDUCE</em> protections for consumers from financial services firms. The Fiduciary Rule prevents our nation&#8217;s seniors from being forced to live on dog food because their retirement savings were turned into fees for New York billionaires. Dodd-Frank&#8217;s data-access permissions have allowed me to find <em>THOUSANDS</em> in fees that I was unwittingly paying.”</li>
<li>“The government is supposed to act in the best interest of its citizens. Consumer protection is crucial&#8211;the Fiduciary Rule and the Dodd-Frank legislation should not be repealed. We are watching and we will remember this and all other acts to strip away our protections when we vote in 2018.”</li>
<li>“The Fiduciary Rule and Dodd-Frank Legislation were born of pain. They were drafted out of a need&#8230;to protect not just the consumers but also the financial institutions from their own greed.”</li>
<li>“Efforts&#8230;to repeal the Fiduciary Rule and Dodd-Frank make perfect sense considering the near ownership of the White House by Goldman Sachs and other special interests. Proof positive that all the talk about &#8216;never forgetting the little guy&#8217; was nothing more than political snake oil.”</li>
<li>“Dodd-Frank&#8230;is not perfect, it could probably use some tweaking with a rational look at what works and what doesn&#8217;t&#8230;. Lets all work together to <em>FIX</em> it, don’t just repeal it.”</li>
<li>“Most people already think that their broker/agent is acting in the their (the consumer&#8217;s) best interest, which is deceitful. Having a Fiduciary Rule means that we can start building a &#8216;true&#8217; trust relationship with them.”</li>
<li>“This is a <em>VERY</em> important rule &#8211; Would you want your doctor acting in her best interest (not yours). I don&#8217;t trust any financial adviser who isn&#8217;t a fiduciary, and don&#8217;t believe anyone else should either.”</li>
<li>“When I call a taxi, I trust that the driver takes care to put my safety first. When I eat at a restaurant, I trust that the food they give me is what I ordered and safe to eat. I expect my bankers to do the same in their practice, and put the interests of their costumers before their own self interest. I ask that my representatives do everything in their power to keep the Fiduciary Rule and the Dodd-Frank legislation. Please stand up for all Americans.”</li>
<li>“Let&#8217;s keep this country on a good solid financial foundation through good decisions, including legislative decisions.”</li>
<li>“If there’s one crisis that we should try to avoid, it should be millions of people completely unprepared for life when they either choose to retire or are replaced/removed from the work force involuntarily. Aside from the personal horrors that will cause, it will also put a burden on us all to increase support in people’s final years.”</li>
<li>“I honestly don’t think this is motivated by anything other than some sort of deranged gambling compulsion by the large financial firms.”</li>
<li>“I am 45, and have suffered through the first dot-com bubble and then the 2008 housing market crisis. As an account holder with Personal Capital, Fidelity, Wells Fargo, TIAA-CREF, Capital One now and in the past, these protections are very important to me. We consumers and individual investors need these rules (and maybe stronger ones) to protect us.”</li>
<li>“This is crazy. I can&#8217;t believe this law was revoked. I am responsible for administrating the 401k for my company. I have personally seen the positive effect this has had for employees.”</li>
<li>“The Fiduciary Rule says that providers of retirement accounts must act in your best interest rather than in their own. No conflicts of interest&#8230;. Regarding the Dodd-Frank legislation &#8212; of particular importance is the effort to take away our rights to get our own financial data from the big banks and brokers.”</li>
<li>“We demand that banks, brokers and our government uphold our ability to see and understand our complete financial situation.”</li>
<li>“I have accounts with several institutions and use aggregation tools to get a good picture of what I am doing. Losing visibility would make managing my accounts difficult. As for the Fiduciary Rule, institutions should be more bound by the rule, in my opinion, not less.”</li>
<li>“FYI, I&#8217;m from Roseville, Calif., which is the 4th Congressional District served by Rep. McClintock. The main thing that jumps out at me about all this is [the role of the government] to serve the &#8216;forgotten America,&#8217; and working class folks&#8230;. That is exactly what the Fiduciary Rule and Dodd-Frank legislation are meant to do.  Protect and serve its citizens, from being swindled of their retirement savings. How, in the name of all that is holy/economic/logical, would this be helpful to its citizens? I need my government to stand up to a banking industry that takes advantage of clients all too often. Most people have no idea of basic investing strategies, which leaves the door open for expensive mutual fund managers to steer their clients toward expensive products.”</li>
<p>“I resist the proposed changes to the Fiduciary Rule and Dodd-Frank legislation. I am strongly against changing these items. I believe it is imperative that I have free access to all of my own financial data, and I feel history has shown that if we do not mandate that financial advisors act in the best interests of their clients they will not do so.”</li>
<li>“I live in the second congressional district of Texas and have various accounts with Fidelity, Vanguard, Citibank and Chase&#8230;. It is very surprising&#8230;that the government is moving with such haste toward wholesale repeal of vital safeguards of our financial system such as the fiduciary rule for retirement advisors and the heavily negotiated system imposed by Dodd-Frank.”</li>
<li>“I would like to continue having access to my entire financial situation and allow the sharing of such information with any institution that I want.”</li>
<li>“Uphold the fiduciary responsibility to all investors by our financial institutions.”</li>
<li>“I am from Denver and I am very concerned about the new legislation to limit my rights to my retirement information and to ensure large banks are looking out for my best interests and not theirs. Please pass along my feedback to our congressman to ensure our consumer rights are preserved.”</li>
<li>“I am very disappointed and upset that a rule that is intended to protect consumers and retirees will be upended&#8230;. We should act together to make sure Congress does not act in favor of big banks and brokers.”</li>
<li>“I completely support the Fiduciary Rule and I think personal wealth-managing professionals should absolutely be required to act in the clients&#8217; best financial interests, not their own or their companies&#8217;. That&#8217;s part of why the financial system is so fraught with fraud, mistrust, and greed.”</li>
<li>“The rules should not be reduced. The money belongs to investors and they should not be cheated.”</li>
<li>“Repealing Dodd-Frank and the Fiduciary Rule would be catastrophic! I&#8217;d move all my accounts overseas.”</li>
<li>“The proposed regulations to undo Dodd-Frank and the fiduciary requirements for financial advisors are guaranteed to put our country in a worse place economically than we are now. Members of Congress must do the right thing and speak out against these moves&#8230;. Expose them for the Wall Street handouts they are.”</li>
<li>“If I can&#8217;t aggregate data for free, I can&#8217;t use multiple services to hold my data. Which means I might as well hide the money under the mattress instead of investing it. What I can&#8217;t measure, I can&#8217;t risk&#8230;. In the likely (?) case that [an aggregator] loses access to my data, what steps can I take?”</li>
<li>“[I’m worried about] the impacts of removing Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank law. I certainly do not support removing that part of the regulation. I currently have accounts with Bank of America, Capital One 360, and a credit union. Like many people from my generation (I am 58), I have had several employers and therefore have several retirement savings accounts scattered among Vanguard, Fidelity, and Securities America, and because I inherited some securities from my mom&#8230;. I think it is outrageous that big banks and financial investment firms are trying to limit my ability to access that data via aggregators. It is an unnecessary infringement on competition in the financial marketplace. Nothing is preventing those firms from offering the same service to their clients.”</li>
<li>“When I am trying to pull together information to file my income tax forms each year, it is a big task to go through all of my accounts and get the information the government requires. If I did not have the ability to pull data from each of my financial services providers into a single program or Web tool&#8230;it would take me even longer to get that data, and it will make it more likely that I would miss items which could have lowered my tax liability. I think it is outrageous that big banks and financial investment firms are trying to limit my ability to access that data via aggregators. It is an unnecessary infringement on competition in the financial marketplace. Nothing is preventing those firms from offering the same service to their clients.”</li>
<li>“I would like to believe the best in people, but history has shown that self-interest trumps ethics far too often &#8211; but the Fiduciary Rule gave me a degree of confidence is making this move.”</li>
<li>“If these consumer safety controls are removed and Fidelity and Schwab decline to commit to full disclosure and fiduciary responsibility, I will pull our 401k&#8217;s the moment my husband and I retire in two years.”</li>
<li>“Frankly, I am appalled both by how predatory our financial system has become as well as how little the federal government does to protect citizens from it.”</li>
<li>“Eliminating the Fiduciary Rule&#8230;is what is criminal! Capitalism can still go on and corporations can still profit without raping the very customers, clients and end users who support them and give them life in the first place. Shame on [them] for lying to and further reminding the &#8216;forgotten men and women&#8217; who blindly thought the government would protect them&#8230;. Oh the forgotten man!!!”</li>
<li>“[I am] mad as hell and&#8230;not going to take it anymore! Drama aside, THIS IS IMPORTANT if you use account aggregation.”
<li>
<li>“It seems like common sense that if you are trusting someone with your money, they should put your interest ahead of theirs. There’s really no good argument against this.”</li>
<li>“[I’ll fight for the ]fiduciary standards and for spreading the word!! I am an educator who just yesterday made a silly SnapChat and Instagram story about this serious subject @CASHCHATSNAP. It’s sooo important to inform the public about fiduciary responsibilities and promoting <em>FINANCIAL LITERACY</em>!!”</li>
<li>“I never want to do business with anyone or service that are not will to give full financial or business disclosure!”</li>
<li>“We have move this country toward a destination of selflessly serving the needs of others instead of self. I lean conservative in my views, but I know businesses will prosper because individuals who are employees will be fulfilled, because deep down we all want to do the right thing. Sometimes we have to have rails for the train to stay on track allowing all to realize that business interests and individual personal needs are not mutually exclusive.”</li>
<li>“The consumers hire financial advisers because they are not an expert in the financial business. The consumers expect and should receive advice that will be in their best interest. Gary Cohn&#8217;s statement is ridiculous. Why would any consumer want advice that isn’t in their best interest? I support the Fiduciary Rule.”</li>
<p>“I support&#8230;efforts to prevent the Trump Administration from eliminating the Fiduciary Rule. As we Baby Boomers continue to age, many will experience reduced cognitive abilities and make us easy prey for unscrupulous financial advisers. I am a registered Independent living in Gwinnett County, Georgia.”</li>
<li>“I think keeping the Fiduciary Rule is very important. I was in the state-sponsored saving system before it was enacted and saw how a lot of people were paying much too much for their investments because there were salespeople with expensive products selling them things they shouldn’t have.”</li>
<li>“I absolutely agree with the Fiduciary Rule.  As a senior citizen with retirement funds, I expect my financial consultant to consider my best interest (not their bottom line). It is logical and makes so much sense. Otherwise they are only bandits, trying to rob me.”</li>
<li>“I’m not sure what [they’re] thinking with this one! Putting the customer first is the right approach, which will cut down putting commissions first and bad behavior by the brokerage community. If this common sense law is changed to give the brokerage community the freedom to offer bad advice and higher commission products without any recourse for the consumer.”</li>
<li>“I simply cannot believe that in this day and age, banks do not understand that customers, including small retail customers, want and deserve access to machine-readable financial data. There are far more important things to do in life than tedious manual entry of financial data.”</li>
<li>“I do not want the Dodd-Frank legislation changed or eliminated. I want to keep intact the section 1033 that allows for transparency of my financial data.”</li>
<li>“I trust no financial institutions to represent me. I will not let Wells Fargo, Chase or any other financial institution control any part of my financial decision.”</li>
</li>
<p>“Dodd-Frank brought much needed sanity to financial services and now [the government is] in collusion with major banks and financial firms bring dishonor to themselves for what they propose.”</li>
<li>“I really appreciate the new digital technology that has helped me know and understand the ‘high fees’ that financial companies were charging me. And I appreciate this technology educating me on my financials to make better decisions. I absolutely agree that removing section 1033, consumer rights to information, is a huge step backwards!!!!!”</li>
<li>“Do not remove Dodd-Frank legislation as a customer I need to be able to see my bank information anywhere I want.”</li>
<li>“Before that happens, could I with draw all the funds and close my accounts? I am scared and I do not understand how these bank steal money from hard working middle class and their life savings. Shame on billionaires.”</li>
<p>There was also a trickle of people who expressed support for repeal:</p>
<li>“I will&#8230;speak up by asking my representatives to work together to reduce needless government regulation which has stymied the economic growth of this great nation, including taking a hard look at Dodd-Frank.”</li>
<li>“We do not need some big agency in Washington to tell us with whom to do business. If I thought a company was not acting in my best interest, I would not do business with them&#8230;. The market generally does a good job in sorting out the schmucks of the world. Adam Smith was correct.”</li>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated in this survey.</p>
